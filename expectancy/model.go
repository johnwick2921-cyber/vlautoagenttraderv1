// Package expectancy is wave 1D: the per-condition expectancy READ MODEL.
//
// It is the table the shadow/promote rulings are made from, and it is a read
// model only — it never gates, sizes, exits, or prompts. Class 23 applies: a
// failure here WARNs and returns an empty table; it may never stop the loop.
//
// Three laws are load-bearing in this package and each one is enforced in code
// rather than in a comment:
//
//   - CORRECTED-COLUMN LAW (A22). Money is read from pnl_corrected ONLY. A NULL
//     is UNRESOLVED: excluded from every figure and COUNTED in Exclusions, never
//     coerced to realized_pnl and never coerced to zero.
//   - SAMPLE-ID LAW (A21). Every cell carries the row ids it was computed from,
//     so any figure in it can be recomputed by a reader who has only the table.
//     This is why every prior money verdict was irreproducible (C4).
//   - NO FABRICATED VALUES. A statistic that cannot be computed is ABSENT (a nil
//     pointer that marshals to null), never a plausible zero. MAE/MFE and the
//     stop/target hit shares stay absent until wave 1A puts rows in
//     trade_excursions.
