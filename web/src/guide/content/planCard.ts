One row per timeframe (D, 4h, 1h): a trend arrow (up/down/range), the last swing high and low, the impulse range with premium/discount as a percentage of the way from the impulse low, and the scorer-ranked HTF zones, each carrying its timeframe badge and freshness label. The chart draws the same zones as bands at their raw contract prices with kind·tf labels — never back-adjusted across the roll — but only on request: by default the mini chart draws the seated levels alone (one labelled line each) and no zone bands; the 'Show zones (N)' checkbox under the mini chart draws the six HTF zones nearest to the last close, identical bands merged (a per-browser view preference, not a strategy knob).
