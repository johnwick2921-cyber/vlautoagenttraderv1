Rows closed before 2026-09-05 record close_reason 'sync' — which says how the row was written, not how the trade ended — so their stop-hit and target-hit shares stay blank and are never inferred from price or from the sign of the P&L. From that date the cause is written from NT8's own exit event ('stop', 'target', 'manual'), and a close with no broker event still records 'sync' rather than a guess. Note that a stop can be profitable: two rows in this store exited at their protective stop in profit, so 'stopped out' and 'lost' are not the same column.",
