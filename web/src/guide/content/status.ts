CANCEL PENDING is a fourth state and it means exactly what it says: a cancel was sent and NO broker book has confirmed the order is gone, so the order may still be resting. Since 2026-09-10 a cancel that times out, or that could not be sent because the NT8 link was down, is HELD at cancel pending rather than written cancelled — cancelled is the word that frees the slot for a replacement, and an unconfirmed cancel must never free it.

A reboot of the machine, or anything that stopped that one node process, took the whole interface with it and left the bot trading blind to its operator.

It is placed only inside its eligibility window and only by the run that recorded it: an unplaced row past the window is closed 'picture eligibility window closed — never placed', a resting limit past it gets its cancel requested, a row recorded by a previous run (a reload) is closed 'recorded by a previous run (epoch …, live …) — not placed'; Stop and Day Plan OFF close its unplaced rows and request the cancel of a resting one; at Stop with no fresh broker book the resting row is held cancel_pending and no cancel is sent blind (it is re-requested once a fresh book exists). A late Stop from a trader instance that a reload has already replaced leaves the replacing run's rows alone; Day Plan OFF still closes every Picture row of the trader. Under plan_mode=direction a Picture scenario on a machine plan (no AI plan yet — its 'neutral' bias means no AI opinion) is judged on its own direction; on an AI plan the AI's bias governs, and the refusal names which rule judged it ('direction: plan bias short'). It is back-inside-invalidated when the newest completed 5m close returns into the broken 4H body. one_setup does not apply to it (one_setup governs planner plays only), and a Picture placement never cancels the plan's unplaced planner arms (nor a planner placement a Picture arm): the one-live-entry guards refuse the second order until the first is closed.

A stock whose ticker is also a CME root (CL, ES, NG) is read as the future, and a chat close of a CME symbol goes to that NinjaTrader trader too. So a chat entry can be sent on an NT8 (CME) trader, and only there. It is then sent through the AI decision's own execute path: reconcile-before-open (which, exactly as for an AI entry, may first flatten a position no ledger row explains), the max-positions limit, the same-side check, and an order row under its signal id, so its fill is tracked like an AI entry's. The contracts you typed are sent as typed or refused — 'refused: quantity N exceeds the max-contracts cap C', or 'refused: quantity N is not a whole number of contracts' — never reduced. The order carries your own stop and target, rounded to the tick like every entry (the stop away from the entry). A refusal by those rails replies 'entry refused before any send (the same execute-side rails as an AI decision): <reason>'. If reconcile had already sent a flatten first, the reply never says the orphan was closed — the flatten may have failed or not been confirmed in time; it says 'a flatten of a position no ledger row explains was SENT first (reconcile-before-open) — it is flat only if the reason below says so, check NT8; the entry was NOT sent: <reason>'. A refusal inside the NinjaTrader connection (the maintenance hold, the entry latch, an unbound or non-SIM account, the duplicate-order guard) is a broker-side failure, not a refusal by those rails: the reply says 'entry send failed at the broker (not an admission refusal): <error>', and if an orphan flatten went out first the error reads 'an orphan flatten was sent first (reconcile-before-open); then the entry failed at the broker: <error>'. On NinjaTrader the reply waits about 3 seconds for the fill confirmation, and up to about 35 seconds more when an orphan must be flattened first.",

It is left alone — and the AI entry refused, counted as 'reconcile_owned' — when, for that account, instrument and side, an armed order carrying a broker signal or a sent Picture entry is live; when an open position's entry order is one of those; or when one of them filled in the last two minutes (twice the reconciler's grace) on any trader bound to that account, running or stopped, and is not recorded as a position yet (a fill recorded a moment after the check began counts as inside those two minutes, never as too old); or when another trader has an open position recorded on that account, instrument and side, however old. A warning names that row. If NinjaTrader no longer holds that trader's position, the row is stale: whenever NinjaTrader holds a position on that side of this account and instrument, the stale row explains it, so every AI entry there is refused and a real orphan on that side is never flattened, until the row is closed (a known limit; a detector for stale rows is owed).

That value comes from the AddOn's subscription ACK, the one frame that names the instrument; it is never derived from a date, and 'n/a' means no ACK has arrived yet, never a guess. On 2026-09-10 at 21:15 CT the subscription rolled September → December on a reconnect, the bar ring kept ~2,000 September bars under the December ones, and a ~292-point step presented to every reader as a move: the desk strip showed a 359-point RANGE, and the 21:29 plan seated 7 of its 12 levels on the retired scale plus one 'fair-value gap' that was the roll itself. Now every stored bar carries its contract, the ring is purged and reseeded on roll, every reader filters to the current contract, and a bar whose window spans the roll is 'unrecomputable:spans_roll' — excluded, never read as one series, never deleted.

      text: "The roll fix booted into a chart that was still discontinuous, and the research archive said why: for the 22:37 CT minute on 2026-09-10, same subscription, same label, NT8's live feed (bar_update, fact 16516009) closed at 29358.25 and its replay (bars_historical, fact 16518205) at 29068.25 — ~290 points apart for the SAME contract. A contract column cannot separate one contract from itself. Since then every bar carries its source: 'live' (the minute as it traded), 'historical' (a replay the ring has judged on the live scale), 'mixed' (a boot or roll minute with one side on each scale — never read) or 'replay:off-scale' (rows two boots wrote on the wrong scale before this fix — never read, overwritten by the next live bar or verified replay; 98 rows, MNQ 51 / ES 47, 21:15–22:38 CT that night). A replay never overwrites a live bar, in the ring or in the store. A replay is HELD out of the store until the first live bar after it lets the ring compare scales: agree → released as historical into the minutes live never wrote; disagree → discarded, the ring drops the seed, refills from the store's live rows, and a P0 prints both closes. An empty minute reads as a gap; a wrong-scale minute reads as the largest move of the day. The boot line '📼 bar source:' prints the census by source, the hold's held/released/discarded counts, both thresholds (0.50% of price AND 20× the seed's median bar body, [I]) and every mismatch this process. The NT8 side — whatever merge/back-adjust policy puts the replay on another scale — is filed for the AddOn wave with those two facts as the evidence.",

The current-contract splice comes first — a ring bar is never replaced by a stored one, an EMPTY ring is never backfilled from the store (no live feed still shows no candles), and a failed store read serves the ring alone. Then, since 2026-09-16 [O], the chart shows EVERY stored contract: prior contracts fill strictly BEFORE the current contract's first live bar, every kline carries its `contract`, and the roll is a visible basis step (MNQ 09-26 → 12-26 was +301.50 at 09-07 04:40 CT) that is never back-adjusted. A 'prior' contract is literally not the current one — the current contract's imported rows that sit in holes of the prior series stay out, so a hole stays a hole rather than becoming a 300-point spike. NOFX_CHART_ACROSS_ROLL=off restores the current-contract-only chart without a rebuild; the resolved value is on the '📈 chart:' boot line. The BOT still decides on the current contract only — the decision readers are contract-pure and no level, plan or arm path reads across the roll.",

On 2026-09-16 the 5m chart was 11 hours deep with 2,000 bars delivered: a zero-bar reconnect replay had re-armed the scale check, the next live bar was judged against a reference eleven hours old, 146 points of overnight move read as a scale break and 1,999 5m + 1,832 1m bars were dropped. Since then the scale check judges NEIGHBOURS only — the replay's last bar and a live bar within two intervals of it; an older reference is a time gap, not a scale gap, and is SKIPPED with both ages printed ('🕳 scale check SKIPPED') while the check stays armed. An empty replay re-arms nothing.
