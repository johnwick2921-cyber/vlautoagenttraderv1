          a: 'The stop itself usually does: working orders are re-synced from the broker. What did NOT survive, until 2026-09-07, was the bot\'s memory of it — the AddOn kept the stop/target pairing in memory only, rebuilt from nowhere, so after a restart auto-breakeven and bracket edits silently did nothing and no one was checking whether a stop was there at all. Now the bot asks the broker directly, every minute a position is open and again on reconnect, and if there is genuinely no stop it raises a P0 and places one. Two honest caveats: on the reconnect edge the answer is usually "UNVERIFIED", because NinjaTrader sends positions and balances on connect but not its order book until the next 30-second beat — the check re-asks a minute later; and protective orders are now GTC rather than Day, so a stop no longer expires at session end while the position it protects lives on.',

Before class 50 (2026-09-02) the rewrite prompt named only the LAST defect, so a chain could be corrected about a fade, fix the fade, and walk back into the voided breakdown it had been rejected for two attempts earlier — which is exactly what the London read did that morning. The rewrite now carries every distinct defect of that read, oldest first, and it is printed twice: at the very top of the prompt, ahead of the playbook, and again at the very end.

          a: "It used to. The prompt ordered a play ('below the prior day\u2019s low you MUST write a continuation short') while the validator voids a continuation into a level price has already reclaimed, so obeying the prompt earned a rejection. Since class 50 the prompt orders a DIRECTION and names the legal conditions, lists every breakdown level already reclaimed as void (decided by the validator\u2019s own code, not a second copy), and prints the minimum stop distance the arm gate will enforce (1.5\u00d7ATR5m, with the current reading) so a stop can be authored right the first time.",

The arm logs 🛑 with the chosen stop, the anchor level, the ATR floor and which one bound. If nothing seated sits within 3×ATR on the risk side the line says stop_unanchored and the ATR floor governs.
