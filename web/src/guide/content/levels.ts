NinjaTrader streams a deep history into memory — over seven years of weekly bars, five years of daily — but only one-minute bars were ever written to disk, so the rest vanished on every restart. The weekly panel built its weeks from those one-minute bars, which start on 19 August, found two complete weeks against a minimum of four, and showed "thin". It was starved beside a full pantry. Now one resolver answers every request for completed bars, preferring NinjaTrader\'s own series and falling back through coarser-to-finer sources, and every timeframe is written to disk so nothing is lost on restart. One caution worth knowing: NinjaTrader\'s weekly bars run Friday to Thursday, while every week in this system runs Monday to Friday. Those bars are stored for research and deliberately never used for the weekly view, which is built from daily bars instead so the weeks line up with the ones you see. The weekly bias signal itself is unchanged by this — only the data feeding it.',
