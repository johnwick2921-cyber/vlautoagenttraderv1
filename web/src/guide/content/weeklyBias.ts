A table that IS complete says "every row PRINTED here is COMPLETE", so the disclosure is not something you only see when something is wrong. A row COUNT cannot see a whole window that is missing, so the heading also counts the rows that are NOT there — "4 WHOLE ROWS ABSENT BETWEEN HELD ROWS" — and the row after each break carries a ⛔ marker naming the CT bounds, because two rows printed next to each other are not necessarily adjacent windows.

The two 1m reads now splice the persisted bars table onto the older end (measured 2026-09-09: MNQ 1m back to 2026-08-19, 21 days). Rules: an EMPTY ring is never backfilled from the store — no live feed still means no plan — a ring that already serves the ask is not second-guessed, only bars strictly older than the ring are taken so a live or forming bar is never replaced, and a failed store read simply serves the ring.

On boot, once the AddOn replay lands, the 1m ring is now extended BACKWARDS from the store, with the counts logged. The ring CEILING is unchanged at 2,500 bars, so this restores the ring to that ceiling immediately instead of climbing to it over a session — about 41.7 h of 1m, not 21 days. The 21-day depth reaches the planner through the store splice described in the card above, which is a different mechanism. Only 1m is rehydrated: the stored 5m/15m/1h rows are NT8 aggregates this repo has judged inconsistent with their own 1m constituents, and they never enter a live regime input. It only ever adds bars older than the ring already has, so a live or forming bar is never overwritten; a symbol with no live bars at all is skipped entirely; and if the store read fails the boot simply continues on the AddOn seed.',

THE NUMBER MOVES, and that is the point: the estimator is byte-for-byte the same rule, but it is no longer fed a 5m ring that could only reach about 7 session-days — it is fed the store-deepened 1m tape aggregated to 5m, which reaches about 9. Measured 2026-09-09 on MNQ: 5m ring 0.876371 over 7 days, 1m tail 0.893543 over 9 days. A boot line reports the window BEFORE and AFTER in days so the step is visible and dated (📈 regime input window).
