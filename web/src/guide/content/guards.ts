The predecessor guard refused only the OPPOSITE side, because on a netting account an opposite-side fill silently nets the position; a same-side add was explicitly out of scope. The block on re-arming the SAME scenario in the same plan version lives in the store (MANUAL-CANCEL-WINS) and survives a restart, but a NEW plan version re-authorizes a terminal row — so a v3 S1 short could have added to a v2 S1 short position that was still open.

Twenty-two of them over two days, none filled, no reject and no error anywhere. Nothing in a log that reads the value we meant to send can catch that; only a build the far side proves by answering can. Limits are untouched by the floor, and the bot states the posture directly on its first armed cycle — and again if it changes: "🎯 stop-entry: seam=… · slots=… · guard=stop-side · unknown=no-op · addon build_id=… expected=… match=…", where slots reads "unproven" until a new enough build answers. Read the seam field FIRST: it is the switch the placement branch consults before any of the others.

The order is now a DIRECTION, with the legal conditions named and the choice left to the model. Second, every breakdown level that price has already closed back across is now listed in the prompt as void, decided by the same code the validator runs rather than by a second copy of the logic that could drift from it. Third, the minimum stop distance is stated up front: since 0B a stop is floored at 1.5×ATR5m, and the planner was never told the number it had to clear.

So a level broken and taken back before the 17:00 evening boundary was dead to the validator and invisible in the prompt. On 2 September at 20:58 the prompt listed eight levels as void, left out the overnight low, and the plan was rejected on exactly that level.
