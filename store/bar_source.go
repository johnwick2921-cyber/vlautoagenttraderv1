// ── BAR-SOURCE WAVE (2026-09-10) — WHICH FEED WROTE THIS BAR ─────────────────
//
// THE FINDING. The contract-roll wave separated MNQ 09-26 from MNQ 12-26
// correctly and then booted into a chart that was still discontinuous. The boot
// line said 12-26=15992 where ~40 were expected; the research archive said why.
// For the 22:37 CT one-minute bar, same subscription, same label:
//
//	fact 16516009  bar_update       (live)    open 29360     close 29358.25
//	fact 16518205  bars_historical  (replay)  open 29068.75  close 29068.25
//
// NT8's replay serves the December contract ~290 points below Tradovate's live
// feed for the SAME minutes. A contract column cannot separate one contract from
// itself. At every boot or reconnect the replay repainted the ring and the store
// low, the live feed continued high, and the boot minute became a mixed bar —
// the 22:39 bar read open 29068.25 close 29355.25, the exact shape the 21:15
// bar had before it.
//
// THE DAMAGE. Go's upsert was unconditional, so that boot's replay overwrote
// 186 live bars across both symbols and six timeframes. Restored from the 22:15
// backup under owner authorisation (markers ac76b47b, 33fee48e).
//
// THE RULE. Every bar names its feed. Live is the minute as it traded and
// overwrites anything. Historical is a replay and fills only what live never
// wrote — in the store (InsertBars' upsert WHERE) and in the ring
// (BarCache.SeedHistorical keeps an existing live bar over an incoming
// historical one). Readers prefer live. A boot minute whose open came from a
// replay and whose close came from live is marked mixed and no reader accepts
// it.
//
// The NT8 side — whatever merge/back-adjust policy makes the replay sit on
// another scale — is filed for the AddOn wave with the two facts above as the
// evidence. This wave makes Go survive it.

// offScaleWindow is one MEASURED span of rows written by a replay on another
// price scale than the live feed, before the replay hold existed. Read-only
// queries on data.db, 2026-09-10 23:3x CDT, before this wave's migration:
//
//	MNQ 12-26, 21:15–22:38 CT open times, o AND c below 29200 → 51 rows
//	  (1m 30 · 3m 9 · 5m 5 · 15m 5 · 30m 2; rowids 464781–465008)
//	ES  12-26, same window, o AND c below 7630 → 47 rows
//	  (1m 26 · 3m 9 · 5m 5 · 15m 5 · 30m 2; rowids 464775–465010)
//
// Live December closes in that window are 29350–29421 / 7660–7677; the
// replay's are 29052–29094 / 7599–7602. The dividing value sits ~150 / ~30
// points from either side. Outside the window the value rule means nothing
// (September traded through 29200 for weeks) and is not applied.
//
// The same windows hold the STRADDLING bars — one side on each scale: the
// roll minutes 21:14–21:17 (whose spans-roll contract labels the 22:39 boot's
// replay overwrote to 12-26, so the roll wave's own rule no longer finds
// them) and the 22:39 boot minute with the aggregates that were open across
// it. 25 rows (MNQ 12, ES 13), labelled mixed by value, never by rowid.

// migrateSourceColumn adds the column (idempotent) and labels pre-existing rows.
//
// PRE-COLUMN ROWS ARE LABELLED LIVE. The first draft labelled them historical
// and called it conservative — "a later live bar may overwrite this". That
// reasoning covered live-over-historical and missed historical-over-historical:
// a future REPLAY overwrites a historical row, which is exactly the damage of
// 2026-09-10 22:39, and the label would have licensed it again at the very next
// boot. The store is the record of what the bot saw as it traded; the whole
// purpose of this wave is that a replay must not repaint that record. So the
// record is live, and only rows this process itself receives as a replay are
// historical.
//
// EXCEPT WHERE THE TAPE SAYS OTHERWISE, MEASURED. The rows an earlier boot's
// replay wrote on the wrong scale (offScale20260910) are labelled
// replay:off-scale — no reader takes them, and a live bar or a verified replay
// may overwrite them, which is the repair path. Their VALUES are untouched
// (A24); the reconstruction from the research archive's live facts is
// owner-authorised separately. Straddling bars (straddle20260910) and any row
// still carrying the roll wave's spans-roll contract are mixed.
//
// Order matters and is idempotent: the value rules run first on unlabelled
// rows, then everything still unlabelled is live. A second run finds nothing
// unlabelled and changes nothing.
