// ── POST-LOSS RE-ARM COUNTER (2026-09-09, dispatch 104 D3) ──────────────────
//
// COUNTER ONLY. It refuses nothing. The research asks how "new fade permissions
// respond after several level failures"; nobody has measured what this desk
// actually does after a loser, so the first job is to count it — a threshold
// invented before the measurement is a threshold nobody can defend.
//
// THE TRIGGER IS A LOSING CLOSE, NOT A STOP-OUT. The dispatch said "after a
// stop-out"; the record says that would observe almost nothing. Of 47 losing
// closes in the retained era (>= 2026-08-15 CT, pnl_corrected NOT NULL,
// excluding the e7 seam), 42 carry close_reason='sync' and only FOUR carry
// 'stop'. A stop-keyed counter would see 4 events and read as "this never
// happens". P&L sign is the honest trigger and needs no attribution to work.
