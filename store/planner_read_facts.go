// ── PLANNER READ FACTS (VOID PARITY wave, 2026-09-02) ────────────────────────
//
// Until now a rendered prompt was persisted ONLY in planner_rejected_prompts,
// i.e. only when a read FAILED. Class 45's VOID / stop-floor sections could
// therefore be proven live only because a read happened to be rejected —
// "does the fix work" and "is the fix present" were the same query, and if the
// fix worked perfectly the evidence disappeared.
//
// This table records what the model was TOLD on EVERY read, accepted or
// rejected: the void list, the stop floor and its ATR, the bias labels, the
// prompt hash and size. It is deliberately small (no prompt text — that stays
// in the rejected store) so the cap can be generous.

	//
	// ScopeBars is NOT redefined by this wave. It has always been
	// len(scope.Bars) — the SERVED count (auto_trader_planner.go). The owner's
	// premise that it recorded the REQUESTED window is NOT REPRODUCED; the two
	// numbers happen to coincide at 2000 because VoidScopeBarCount() is 2000
	// and the ring held at least that many. Renaming its meaning would silently
	// reinterpret 67 correct rows.
	//
	// What was missing is the SPAN and the CONTINUITY of that served tape. On
	// 2026-09-09 rows 65 and 66 recorded 2000 bars that WERE delivered, across
	// a 3055-minute window with 696 open-market minutes missing inside it, and
	// no field could express the difference.
	//
	// UNKNOWN vs ZERO: when ReadHorizons is NULL or "" the four numerics below
	// were never computed and are UNKNOWN, NOT zero. Gate every query on
	// HorizonRecorded() (in SQL: `where read_horizons is not null and
	// read_horizons != ''`) and state the excluded COUNT (corrected-column law,
	// class 40) with `where read_horizons is null or read_horizons = ''`.
	//
	// THE NULL HALF MATTERS AND WAS WRONG UNTIL REVIEW (2026-09-09). AutoMigrate
	// adds these columns with no DEFAULT, so the 68 rows that pre-date the wave
	// (ids 1..68) hold NULL, not "". The INCLUSION test survives that — `NULL
	// != ''` is NULL, so those rows are excluded, correctly — but the
	// count-the-excluded test written as `where read_horizons = ''` returns 0,
	// a plausible zero over 68 genuinely unresolved rows. That is the exact
	// A24 failure this column exists to prevent, so both halves are spelled out
	// above. This reuses the "" vs "[]" convention VoidLevels already
	// established, rather than adding a boolean that can drift out of agreement
	// with the text.

	// was, and a query author reading the field doc would have been misled
	// (corrected in review, 2026-09-09). Until that entry lands, a row's
	// stop_floor_pts still cannot be explained from its own row: the floor comes
	// from plannerATR5m's separate 5m×200 fetch while scope_* describes the 1m
