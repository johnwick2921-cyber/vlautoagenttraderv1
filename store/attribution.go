// ── ATTRIBUTION INTEGRITY (2026-09-02) — ONE SENTINEL ────────────────────────
//
// A position's plan link has THREE states, and before this file two of them
// were spelled the same way. `position_plan_join`'s comment has said since
// 2026-08-26 that "unresolvable rows keep plan_id='UNRESOLVABLE'", and four
// rows do (530, 539, 545, 546) — but three others carry "" (566, 571, 580),
// which is also what a row looks like before anything stamps it. A consumer
// testing the sentinel misses them; a consumer testing "" misses the four.
//
// MEASURED before building: since the day-plan era began, 51/51 `system` and
// 5/5 `armed_entry` closed positions carry a real link, as do 8 of 11
// `reconcile` rows. The gap is three rows, none of which has an arm within
// thirty minutes — there is nothing to join on, so the honest value is the
// SENTINEL. We never guess a link.

// PlanLinkState is what a consumer actually needs to branch on.
