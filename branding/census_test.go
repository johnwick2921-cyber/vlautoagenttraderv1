// Census guard (Z17, plan v7 FINAL item 10): every tracked file's count
// of the old brand token (assembled at runtime below) must EQUAL its
// allowed count in the transition table. This file and the table never
// contain the old name in any casing; wrapper paths use the {OLD}
// placeholder, expanded at runtime. Entries and the Ceiling may only
// go DOWN; the CTO rejects any PR that raises either. This table is
// PROVISIONAL (generated at the D2-DEAD+WEB merge head); the final
// re-pin lands after the ops + agent/addon parts merge.
