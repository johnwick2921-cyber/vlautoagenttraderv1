// with `current` a symlink, so an activation or a rollback moves all three
// halves at once and can never leave a mixed install.
//
// THIS IS THE ONE RESOLVER, for the same reason the data directory has one.
// The first version of this feature read os.Getenv in TWO places: api resolved
// it once behind a sync.Once, kernel re-read it on every call. Those two can
// DISAGREE — the api half keeps the value it latched while the kernel half
// picks up a later one — so the process would serve a bundle from one release
// while judging its boot integrity against another, and each half would be
// internally consistent and quietly describing a different install. The whole
// point of resolving once is defeated by resolving once per package.
//
// UNSET is the default and means today's behaviour, byte for byte.
