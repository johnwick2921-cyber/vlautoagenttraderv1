// ── recovery_needed: the job-specific manual steps (C16 as ruled) ──────────
//
// deploy/RESTORE.md kills with pgrep, proves boots with journalctl and
// rebuilds from the source tree; none of that is safe here. These steps name
// THIS job's snapshot, backup and shas, restart by the unit's MainPID only
// (kill -9: SIGTERM exits 0 and systemd's Restart=on-failure would not
// relaunch), prove the boot from the data log + /api/health, and clear the
// hold LAST — until then every entry stays refused. RESTORE.md is cited only
// for its database-restore section. TestRollbackFailureIsRecoveryNeededAndStops
// pins the text free of pgrep, journalctl and the version-control tool.

// RecoveryText renders the manual steps for a recovery_needed job.
