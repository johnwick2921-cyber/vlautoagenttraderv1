// releaseroot.go — W-ONE-BUTTON M4 (3b-B, unit U4F): the ONE check of the
// release root (NOFX_RELEASE_DIR, read through installpath's one resolver)
// against the installation. `nofx-updater fetch` materializes under it and the
// re-proof adapter refuses a verdict that is not under it, so both call this
// and nothing else.
//
// Containment is decided on RESOLVED paths and on path ELEMENTS:
//   - the root must be its own resolved path (filepath.EvalSymlinks): a symlink
//     anywhere in it is refused, because text that looks outside the install
//     can still point inside (verifier U4N defect 2, probe P2);
//   - the install dir is resolved too, so an install named through a symlink
//     cannot make a root inside the real install look outside;
//   - the root is outside the install only when the relative path IS ".." or
//     starts with "../" — never a string prefix: "<install>/..rel" is a
//     directory inside the install whose name starts with ".." (defect 1).
//
// The last two are the module's ONE containment check, PathWithin
// (containment.go, U4F verify note 5).
