# W-BARS-CONTRACT-KEY rollback (2026-09-18) — RESTORE.md Option A, scripted.
#
# Puts the PRE-MIGRATION bars table (bars_pre_contract_key_<date>, keyed
# (symbol, tf, open_time_ms), its legacy indexes still attached) back under the
# name `bars`, and parks the migrated table as bars_contract_key_<date>. Run
# BEFORE starting a binary older than the wave on a migrated database: that
# binary's upsert names ON CONFLICT(symbol, tf, open_time_ms), which the new key
# does not satisfy — SQLite refuses every write and persistence dies silently.
#
# Idempotent: with no bars_pre_contract_key_* table there is nothing to do.
#
#   deploy/bars-key-rollback.sh [--force] [--db PATH]
#
# rc 0 = rolled back · rc 4 = nothing to do (already on the old key) ·
# rc 2 = refused: bot running (use --force) · rc 3 = refused: unsafe state ·
# rc 1 = a step failed (the transaction rolled back; nothing renamed).
