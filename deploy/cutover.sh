#!/usr/bin/env bash
# W-ONE-BUTTON M4 — the manual boot, v7.
#
#   usage: cutover.sh [--dry-run] <new-sha40> <new-bin> [new-dist]
#
# v7 is a THIN WRAPPER over cmd/nofx-activate. v6 reimplemented the activation
# steps in bash; two implementations of a safety procedure drift, and the one
# that drifts is the one nobody runs until an incident. Everything that can be
# expressed as a step now runs the same Go code the unattended worker (3b-B)
# will run. What stays here is what only the attended boot does: parse the
# operator's arguments, hold the token gate, and refuse.
#
# v6 SEMANTICS PRESERVED, deliberately and testably:
#   --dry-run performs every preflight and kills/swaps/writes NOTHING
#   the flat gate (class 33) must answer READY before anything is touched
#   NOFX_CUTOVER_TOKEN is read from the environment, NEVER a command-line arg
#   the new binary is PROVEN before anything moves (two distinct refusals,
#     class 248: no vcs stamps at all vs stamped with a different revision)
#   the dist must carry the sha being installed
#   rollback restores ALL THREE halves and proves the OLD rev
#
# ONE REAL DEFECT v6 CARRIED, fixed by the delegation rather than patched:
#   start_ticks() read /proc/<pid>/stat with `split($0,a," "); print a[22]`.
#   The comm field is in parentheses and MAY CONTAIN SPACES AND PARENTHESES,
#   which shifts every later field — so the identity check could compare the
#   wrong number and either refuse a valid restart or, worse, accept a
#   recycled pid. internal/activation parses from the LAST ')' and is pinned
#   by a test whose comm is literally "(nofx bin (x))".
#
# NO SECRETS ARE WRITTEN OR ECHOED ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE.
