# The way back is decided by the DISK binary's vcs.revision, but the disk binary
# is not the running build: a crashed staging leaves a never-proven file on disk
# while the old process keeps serving. The reconcile refuses unless the disk
# revision agrees with BOTH /api/health (the running process's own revision) and
# the RELEASE marker, and refuses outright when neither answers.
#
# Three fixtures, each driving the PRODUCTION script (not a re-implementation):
#   F1 all agree (disk == health == RELEASE)      -> proceeds, dry run completes
#   F2 disk != health                             -> refuses, names the mismatch
#   F3 neither health nor RELEASE answers         -> refuses, cannot reconcile
