# nofx-claim — PART 3 step 0's claim commit, made checkable.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Step 0 (push-empty-at-accept, born class 70) stops two lanes
# building the same wave. On 2026-09-04 it worked exactly as designed: it caught
# a genuine collision on fix/reaper-reads-snapshot within 70 seconds. And it
# still failed at the only thing that mattered next — the claim read
#
#   claim: reaper reads the snapshot, not order_update silence (PART 3 step 0)
#
# which proves a collision and cannot resolve it. No session name, so the lane
# that found it could prove someone else held the wave and had no idea whom to
# ask. In this repo every commit carries the identical git author, so the author
# field answers nothing (PROVENANCE, CLAUDE.md). The claim message is the ONLY
# place a reachable identity can live.
#
# The step-0 template already showed <session>. A template is a suggestion; this
# is the check that makes it a rule.
#
#   nofx-claim new <branch> "<wave>"        # create + push a well-formed claim
#   nofx-claim check [branch]               # validate one branch's claim  (rc 1 = bad)
#   nofx-claim audit                        # every origin claim commit    (rc 1 = any bad)
#
# NOFX_SESSION names the lane; it is required for `new`.

# The contract. All three parts are mandatory:
#   claim: <wave> — <wave>-<uuid-prefix>/<ListAgents-name>[<ref>], <ISO-8601 with offset>
#
# THE SESSION FIELD MUST BE ROUTABLE, NOT MERELY ATTRIBUTABLE (owner ruling
# 2026-09-07, AUDIT-CHECKLIST PART 3 step 0). The 2026-09-04 rule fixed
# attribution — a claim names WHO. It did not fix ADDRESSING: the uuid prefix
# lives in the claim/lock namespace, ListAgents addresses sessions by a short ref
# in another, and nothing joins them. On 2026-09-07 a lane hit a collision on
# fix/session-calendar, read the holder's name, and could not send it a message:
# ListAgents offered four sessions and none matched. One relay went to ALL FOUR
# because there was no way to send it to one.
#
# The ref may be the literal [unlisted] when a lane cannot read its own — never
# omitted, never guessed (A24).
