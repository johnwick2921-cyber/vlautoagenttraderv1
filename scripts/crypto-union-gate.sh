# CANONICAL TABLE FORMAT (CTO ruling, C13 table review 2026-10-01 — CR-B's
# markdown pipe row is canonical; one row per hit LINE):
#   branch-point: <40-hex sha>          # the part's branch point
#   integrator-tip: <40-hex sha>        # the integrator tip it was generated against
#   paths: <space-separated pathspecs>  # the part's swept paths
#   regex: <the assembled literal>      # MUST equal the guard's export, byte-for-byte
#   | path | line | token | DELETE|CUT|KEEP | OWNER | reason |
#   # a table with zero rows writes an explicit line instead:
#   0 hits
#   # OWNER names the part that owns the line (CR-A|CR-B|CR-C). A table MAY
#   # list a line it does not own as a CEDED row (OWNER = the owning part).
#   # EXACTLY ONE owner per hit line across the union — a double-claim FAILS.
#
# DIALECT (CR-C, accepted): the four headers may be written as bullets
#   (- branch point: <sha> [comment] / - integrator tip at generation: <sha> /
#    - paths: … / - regex: …), path/token fields may be backtick-wrapped, and a
#   dated-export file may carry ONE blanket row `| <path> | - | count=N | KEEP |
#   OWNER | reason |` instead of per-line rows — the gate verifies the file's
#   hit-line count EQUALS N (a silent-skip-proof; a mismatch FAILS). A `regex:`
#   header without the literal must state its programmatic source; the byte
#   check then falls back to sweep coverage (zero unlisted hits proves the
#   generator's literal matched the guard's).
#
# Gate rules (C13 invariants 1-5 + the CTO's content-asserts):
#   (1) every table exists and parses: >=1 row or the explicit "0 hits" line;
#       any line that is not a header/comment/canonical row is a FAIL.
#   (2) two shas: `git merge-base --is-ancestor <branch-point> HEAD` holds AND
#       `git diff --name-only <integrator-tip>..HEAD -- <paths>` is empty.
#   (3) git failure = FAIL, never a skip.
#   (4) canary: every KEEP row's token is re-found by the sweep in its file;
#       if the union holds NO KEEP rows, the guard test's sentinels are the
#       canary (printed as n/a here).
#   (5) ONE regex: each table's `regex:` header equals the guard's exported
#       literal (extracted programmatically from branding/no_crypto.go), byte
#       for byte — a hand-typed copy fails.
#   Sweep: git ls-files -z, >=2000-file floor, GNU grep -E -i -I -n (binary
#   files skipped). Every hit line must have rows in the union, EXACTLY ONE
#   distinct owner across the union, and be covered by a KEEP row whose token
#   the line contains (case-insensitive) — a DELETE/CUT-owned hit means the
#   cut has not happened at this head. FILE-LEVEL exclusivity (Finding 3):
#   every PATH appearing in any table has exactly ONE owner across the union;
#   a path with two owners FAILS even when its lines split cleanly.
#   Content asserts (single-quoted 'mixed' sites the regex cannot see):
#       web/src/components/plan/ExecutorVerdict.tsx   arm.state === 'mixed'      -> must be PRESENT (KEEP)
#       web/src/components/trader/TraderConfigModal.tsx source_type === 'mixed'  -> if present, the union must name it (CUT); absent = cut complete
