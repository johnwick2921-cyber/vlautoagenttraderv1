# mutate — a mutation test that cannot report a verdict it has not earned.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A mutation test answers one question: "if I break this line,
# does a pin notice?" It is only evidence when the break actually happened. Four
# times in one week this repo recorded a SURVIVOR that was nothing of the kind:
#
#   · three seds never matched (class 89 — a search string with three spaces
#     where gofmt had left one). The file was untouched, the suite passed
#     because nothing was broken, and "SURVIVED" went into a report as proof
#     that a pin was weak. It was proof of a typo.
#   · one mutant did not compile. `go test` reported a build failure, the
#     harness read the absence of "--- FAIL" as a pass, and called it SURVIVED.
#
# Both failures share a shape: the harness inferred a verdict from the ABSENCE
# of a failure line, without first establishing that the experiment ran. So this
# script refuses to read the suite until it has proven two things happened —
# the edit landed, and the mutant builds. Any other outcome is named, never
# folded into SURVIVED.

#
# Exit codes are the verdict, so a caller can branch on them:
#   0 KILLED         the mutant broke a pin — the pin guards this line
#   1 SURVIVED       the mutant built, ran, and NOTHING failed — the pin is weak
#   2 NOT-APPLIED    the sed matched nothing — the experiment never ran
#   3 BUILD-FAILED   the mutant does not compile — the experiment never ran
