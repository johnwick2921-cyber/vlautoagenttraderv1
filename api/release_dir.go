// ReleaseDirBootLine reports which versioned runtime this process resolved, as

//
// WHY A SEPARATE LINE: §3 asked for both "unset ⇒ byte-identical boot lines"
// and "the boot line prints the resolved dir, n/a when unset". Appending an
// n/a segment to the 🖥 line would change its bytes and break every golden
// that reads it, so the two requirements are only compatible if the new value
// gets its own line. Unset still prints — an absent knob is a FACT worth
// stating, and a reader who sees no line at all cannot tell "unset" from
// "this build does not have the feature".
//
// The value is READ from the resolver, never assumed, and an unset knob prints
// the literal n/a rather than an empty gap that looks like a missing field.
