# RESEARCH INDEX — everything commissioned 2026-08-17 → 2026-09-01

**STANDING RULE (owner, 2026-09-03): a docs branch merges to dev the SAME DAY it is pushed — a report not on dev does not exist.** Eight branches were merged under that rule on 2026-09-03 (dev `338867f9`), all verified docs-only (40 files, 40 under `docs/`) and each report curl'd 200 at raw/dev.

Archive merged to dev 2026-09-01 by `docs/research-archive-merge` (docs-only; no code, no content edits). Each stranded artifact keeps its original filename; collisions are suffixed with the branch slug. Source branch + original commit sha recorded per row. Reports are historical artifacts — a wrong report stays wrong; corrections happen in later waves, not here.

Legend — Action: **shipped** (wave name) · **queued** · **owner-ruled** · **NONE**. Conflicts: →DUPLICATE (agree) / →CONTRADICTION (owner-ruled).

Orphaned findings (carried from the inventory §B): knob-census top-10 unvalidated · cheap-five · confirm-cost −$681 · mega-research calibration queue · weekend-p2 min-conf/proximity buckets (Sep-9) · level-system weight divergences · strategy-controls DEAD register · controls-runtime gate-65 defect (closure UNKNOWN) · london-drought open questions · latency T1/T2/T4 instrumentation + completion diet.
Duplicates (§D): london-drought ×2 (agree) · pre-livefire ×2 (superset) · VWAP residual ×2 (resolved).
Contradictions (§E): fvg_entry study vs demand prompts (0C shadow) · min-conf 65 vs 60 (60) · proximity (0.3) · side-quota (removed) · VWAP residual (data bug) · volume weights (documented, live code wins).

## 2026-09-03 — the stranded-branch sweep

**25 docs-only branches merged** (verified by PATH, not by name; all test-merged
conflict-free at `33286ac6` before the lock was taken). Every one is listed
**unclassified**: it is now ON DEV and therefore exists, but nobody has read it
and no verdict is claimed. Reading them is separate work — the standing rule is
about existence, not endorsement.

### 11 branches NOT merged — named `docs/*` but carrying code

The owner's rule is that a docs branch merges the same day. These are not docs
branches. Each carries Go tests, a compiled command, analysis scripts or a
README — none of it production trading code, but all of it entering `go build`,
`go test` or the repo root, which a documentation merge must not do silently.
**Anything worth keeping from them gets its own `fix/` branch** (owner ruling
2026-09-03). Two of them, `dress-rehearsal-0830` and `pre-livefire-verify-0830`,
add overlapping copies of `cmd/vfverify/*` and would fight each other.
