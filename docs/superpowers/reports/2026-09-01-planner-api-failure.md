# 2026-09-01 — Planner API failure: root cause + fix (class 37)

**Dispatch:** PLANNER API FAILURE — ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION + FIX (owner hoang, 2026-09-01).
**Phase 1 verdict:** CONFIRMED. **Phase 2:** shipped on branch `fix/planner-stream-total-deadline`
(worktree `~/nofx-planner-api`), merged to dev at `bc9ea126`; **CUT OVER 21:19:49 CT on the owner's "GO 37"** (rev `e42a0b43`, PID 1994488)
— see CUTOVER section. Behavioural proof still owed (A20). Section "Phase 2" below carries file:lines, tests, build, rollback.
All times CT (R8). Evidence tiers: **[A]** directly verified · **[B]** inferred · **[C]** speculation.
Evidence classes: [RUNTIME] journal/log lines · [DB] `data/data.db` read-only queries ·
[CODE] file:line · [CONFIG] `.env` / boot line. Window: `journalctl -u nofx --since 2026-08-29 00:00`
(08-29 carried 0 AI calls — Saturday, CME closed; first AI call 08-30 09:41 CT).

## TL;DR

- **One endpoint, one model, one row is called.** Every one of the 1,342 `Request URL` lines in the
  window is `https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions`; every one of the 1,336 `ai_call` lines is
  `model=deepseek-v4-pro` (1,322 ok / 14 failed) [A][RUNTIME]. The only trader (`hoang`) is bound to
  ai_models row `8ef641a7-…_deepseek` ("DeepSeek AI"); the "DeepSeek 2" row has **zero** traders and
  zero planner bindings — nothing calls it [A][DB].
- **The failing "API" is our own 600 s whole-request ceiling, not the provider.** 11 of the 14 failures
  are `http.Client.Timeout` kills at exactly 600,000–600,001 ms while the model was still streaming
  reasoning (71k–140k reasoning chars already received, ttfb 474–578 ms) [A][RUNTIME]. The other 3
  are TCP resets mid-stream (2 planner, 1 executor), **all recovered by the client retry** [A].
  0 × HTTP 4xx/5xx, 0 × 429, 0 × auth, 0 × DNS/TLS, 0 × idle-watchdog kills [A].
- **Who gets killed:** 11 of 80 max-reasoning full-author/re-author planner attempts (13.8 %);
  0 of 22 repair attempts; 0 of 42 fast-reasoning attempts [A]. Successful max full reads:
  n=69, p50 447.8 s, p90 552.0 s, p95 581.1 s, max 599.5 s — right-censored at the ceiling [A].
- **Root defect [CODE]:** the planner-speed wave (2026-08-31) put the planner on SSE with a 30 s idle
  watchdog and documented "the whole-request ceiling stays http.Client.Timeout (600s) — a live-but-slow
  stream is never killed" (`kernel/planner_speed.go:23-24`, `mcp/client.go:951-953`, guide
  `settings.ts:159`). Both halves cannot be true: `http.Client.Timeout` bounds the body read, so the
  live stream dies at 600 s. The 4.4 fixture used `Timeout: 10s` against a 0.5 s stream and never
  crossed the ceiling (`mcp/stream_watchdog_test.go:24`).
- **Fix (class 37):** the planner stream gets its own ceiling `AI_PLAN_TOTAL_DEADLINE_SECS`
  (default 1200 s, from the distribution: 2× max observed success; ≈ the 65,536-token cap at the median
  65 tok/s) on a per-call copy of the HTTP client with `Timeout=0`; the 600 s ceiling stays on every
  non-stream path (executor loop, weekly read, Ask-Planner). Every failed `ai_call` now carries
  `class=` + `http_status=` + `request_id=`; the planner logs `provider_row=` on failure; boot lines
  print idle/total/ceiling/retries/row.

## B1 — Outbound APIs on the planner path

Provider-row resolution [A][RUNTIME `trader/auto_trader_planner.go:64-110`]: every read logs
`🧠 planner model: empty binding → using primary, pinned "deepseek-v4-pro"` — `day_plan.planner_model`
is empty in all 9 strategies rows, so the planner uses the trader's primary client (row #1 below).

## B2 — Failure table (last 72 h; every `ai_call … ok=false`)

Source: `journalctl -u nofx --since "2026-08-29 00:00" | grep "ai_call .*ok=false"` (14 lines) joined
to the `🧠 planner call (…) completed in`, `📊 AI call complete (stream)`, `📐 planner attempt`,
`⚠️ … retrying` lines and to `plans` / `planner_rejected_prompts` rows. Trigger class comes from the
plan row the read wrote (none written = wake/re-plan that kept the prior plan). Provider row for every
row: `8ef641a7-…_deepseek` (the only one called). Reasoning mode for every planner row: `enabled/max`.

Notes [A]: "200 (headers)" — every kill had a normal ttfb, i.e. the provider had answered and was
streaming; the HTTP status is not printed by the old binary (fixed in Phase 2). Pre-speed-wave rows
(K1-K4, T1) ran the non-stream path and carry no ttfb/reasoning fields (the `client.go:225` format).
The **599.5 s success** the dispatch cites is 08-31 17:10:03 (ASIA read attempt 1, `wall_ms=599526`,
`finish_reason=stop`, ttfb 2218 ms) — 474 ms under the ceiling.

## B4 — Which one keeps failing

The DeepSeek chat/completions endpoint at `https://api.deepseek.com`, model `deepseek-v4-pro`, row
`8ef641a7-815c-4bb5-9798-b070b67d7998_deepseek` ("DeepSeek AI") — because it is the only one called
(n = 1,336 ai_call, 14 failures, 1.0 %). Within it the failures are **one class**: 11 of 14 are the
600 s ceiling on live max-reasoning planner streams (n = 80 such attempts → 13.8 % kill rate); the
remaining 3 are recovered TCP resets. The "DeepSeek 2" row (`396db319-…_deepseek_0751c0b6`) is not
called by anything: `traders.ai_model_id LIKE '%0751c0b6%'` → 0 rows; the trader that once used it
(the 08-18 audit's "other trader 0751c0b6") no longer exists in `traders`.

## B5 — Candidate verdicts

| Cand. | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| (a) 600 s total deadline too short for max-reasoning authors | **CONFIRMED [A]** | 11/80 max full attempts killed at 600000-600001 ms with reasoning chars still growing (5 of the 7 stream kills at the normal 211-233 chars/s → the model simply needed > 600 s; successes reached 135,262 chars in 484 s). Success distribution p50 447.8 / p90 552.0 / p95 581.1 / max 599.5 s is right-censored. Repair (n=22) and fast (n=42) attempts: 0 kills. |
| (b) 30 s idle deadline trips during reasoning gaps | **RULED OUT [A]** for the window | 0 kills with `timeout_source=context`; every stream kill says `Client.Timeout`; ttfb 355-2218 ms; reasoning deltas stream continuously. |
| (c) second DeepSeek row misconfigured and routed to | **RULED OUT as a cause [A]; key content UNVERIFIABLE (A25)** | 0 traders bound; `day_plan.planner_model` empty in all 9 strategies; every read logs "empty binding → using primary"; both rows' non-key columns identical (B6). Whether row 2 holds an old key cannot be checked without decrypting it — irrelevant while nothing calls it. |
| (d) provider-side 429 / 5xx | **RULED OUT [A]**; provider **throughput variance is a CONTRIBUTING factor [B]** | 0 non-200 statuses. But reasoning throughput fell to 119-121 chars/s for K10/K11 (12:33-12:43) and 155-167 chars/s for the 12:52-17:23 reads vs 230-279 chars/s 08:00-12:06 the same day — at half speed a normal 95k-char read needs ~800 s, so the fixed ceiling kills more often when the provider is slow. |
| (e) retry arithmetic masks then exhausts | **RULED OUT [A]** (arithmetic quoted) | Planner loop = 3 attempts (`auto_trader_planner.go:1334`); client `MaxRetries` = `AI_MAX_RETRIES=2` (`.env:33`) → worst case 3 × 2 = 6 provider calls. Observed: the ceiling kill is **not** retried at the client level (`IsRetryableError` matches the lowercase token "timeout"; the Go error says "Client.Timeout" — case-sensitive, `mcp/client.go:33-49,606-615`; 0 `retrying` lines follow any of the 11 kills), so each kill costs exactly 600 s and one planner attempt. Only the 3 transport resets used the client retry (2/2), each once. Worst observed read: K10+K11+attempt 3 = 12:23:07 → 12:52:48 = 29 min 41 s. |
| (f) WSL2 proxy / network | **RULED OUT as the main cause [A]**; minor class | 3 resets in 1,336 calls (0.22 %), all `read: connection reset by peer` from 3.173.21.63:443 at 31-272 s into a call, all recovered; 0 DNS/TLS errors; keepalive 30 s (`security/url_validator.go:161`). |
| (g) malformed / oversized request | **RULED OUT [A]** | prompt estimate on killed attempts 6336-6544 tokens vs 6240-6691 on successes; provider-counted prompt on successes 9402-9935; identical request builder; `finish_reason=length` count 0 (`truncated-responses=0` at every boot). |

Client config in force (resolved [CONFIG] `.env` via godotenv + boot line 09-01 17:24:00 of the running
binary ec6632f9; the process env is not readable from this shell, so `.env` is the resolved source):
`AI_HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=600` (`.env:32`) → `http.Client.Timeout` 600 s and `timeout=600s` on the boot
line · `AI_MAX_RETRIES=2` (`.env:33`) → `retries=2` · backoff 2 s (default) · `AI_MAX_TOKENS=32768`
(`.env:19`, executor cap) · `AI_PLAN_MAX_TOKENS` unset → 65536 · `AI_PLAN_STREAM_IDLE_SECS` unset → 30 s
· `RETRY_MODE` unset → repair · `AI_PLAN_REASONING` unset → max · `FAST_MARKET_REASONING` unset → low.
The boot-time masked key fingerprint line exists in the journal and is deliberately not quoted here.

## B7 — Root cause (one paragraph)

The planner's SSE call still runs under `http.Client.Timeout = AI_HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 600 s`
[CONFIG `.env:32`; CODE `mcp/config.go:69,76` builds the transport with `ResolvedAITimeout()`, and
`mcp/client.go:1005` issues the stream request through that same `client.HTTPClient`], while the
speed-wave code and guide assert the opposite ("a live-but-slow stream is never killed" —
`kernel/planner_speed.go:23-24`, `mcp/client.go:951-953`, `web/src/guide/content/settings.ts:159`)
[CODE]. `http.Client.Timeout` bounds the body read, so any max-reasoning attempt still streaming at
600.0 s dies with `stream interrupted: context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout …)` — 11 of 80 such
attempts between 08-30 21:20 and 09-01 12:43 CT, each with a normal ttfb and 71k-140k reasoning
chars already received [RUNTIME]. The max-reasoning duration distribution sits directly against the
ceiling (successes p50 447.8 s, p95 581.1 s, max 599.5 s; the kills needed more) [RUNTIME], and
provider throughput variance (119-121 chars/s at 12:33-12:43 vs 211-279 chars/s elsewhere) pushes
more reads over it [RUNTIME, B]. Nothing else fails: 0 non-200 statuses, 0 auth, 0 429, 0 idle-kills,
and the second DeepSeek row is unbound [RUNTIME][DB]. The 3 TCP resets are a separate, minor,
self-healing class. Because the kill is not retryable at the client level (case-sensitive token
mismatch) and the planner loop treats it like a validator reject, each kill costs exactly one of the
three attempts plus 600 s, and its transport text is fed back to the model as a "validator reason"
(`planner_rejected_prompts` 71-72) — without a class token on the `ai_call` line, which is why it
read as "the API keeps failing".

## Secondary findings (observability, not fixed unless stated)

1. **Stale telemetry on failure [A]** — T3's `ai_call` line reports `reasoning_chars=7092 ttfb_ms=0`
   inherited from the previous (planner) call because the atomics are only written on success
   (`mcp/client.go:1013-1015`). **Fixed in Phase 2** (`resetCallTelemetry` at call start).
2. **Timeout text fed to the model as a validator reason [A]** — `runPlannerReadCoreWithFactsGrades`
   handles `call()` errors and validator rejects identically (`auto_trader_planner.go:1348-1354`):
   `plannerRejectBlock(lastErr)` puts "stream interrupted: context deadline exceeded…" into attempt 2's
   prompt tail and `SaveRejectedPrompt` stores it (ids 71, 72). **NOT changed** — Section F forbids
   planner-prompt changes in this dispatch; owner ruling requested (skip the reject block for
   transport/deadline classes; tag the stored row with the class).
3. **Client-level retry never covers the ceiling kill [A]** — `retryableErrors` contains "timeout",
   the Go error says "Client.Timeout" (case-sensitive `strings.Contains`). Kept as-is on purpose
   (retrying a 600 s kill would double the loss; the planner loop owns that retry) and **pinned by a
   test in Phase 2** so a future "fix" cannot silently make it 3 × 2 × 600 s.
4. **Fixture gap [A]** — `TestStreamSlowButAliveSurvivesIdle` used `http.Client{Timeout: 10s}` with a
   ~0.5 s stream; the ceiling was never crossed, so the false "never killed" claim passed CI. Phase 2
   adds the crossing fixture.


## Phase 2 — FIX (class 37), shipped to branch, PARKED before cutover

Gate check: B7 = CONFIRMED; the fix is a split of one deadline plus observability (14 files, +639/−30,
no prompt/validator/schedule change). Lock: `~/nofx-main.lock` acquired (owner hoang/claude, pid 1906840
alive, expiry 21:35 CT, task planner-api-failure-0901); worktree `~/nofx-planner-api` on branch
`fix/planner-stream-total-deadline` (locked), base `origin/dev` = `795f67f7`. **The main tree was never
edited** (porcelain clean throughout; only the ignored `nofx-bin.next` was staged).

### Commits on the branch

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `638af5ed` | this report, Phase 1 |
| `75130d59` | the fix + tests + guide + checklist (below) |
| `225bc367` | deploy marker — `deploy/RELEASE` and `GUIDE_BUILT_REV` = `75130d593c2ae2a98abe4500c62f859111475bef` |

### The change, file:line (at `75130d59`)

| File | Lines | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `kernel/planner_speed.go` | 22-59 | `PlannerStreamTotalSeconds()` — `AI_PLAN_TOTAL_DEADLINE_SECS`, default **1200**, junk → default, `total <= idle → idle + 60`; the false "never killed" comment replaced |
| `mcp/client.go` | 211-306 | sentinels `ErrStreamIdleDeadline` / `ErrStreamTotalDeadline`; `classifyAIError` (total_deadline · idle_deadline · client_timeout · http_status · auth_config · transport · context · other); `requestIDFrom` (X-Request-Id / Request-Id / X-Amzn-Requestid / Cf-Ray); `resetCallTelemetry`; accessors `LastErrClass` / `LastHTTPStatus` / `LastRequestID` |
| `mcp/client.go` | 322-357 | `logAICall`: `timeout_source` gains `planner_total` / `stream_idle`; failure line gains `class= http_status= request_id=`; success line gains `http_status= request_id=` |
| `mcp/client.go` | 509, 531-532 | non-stream `Call`: telemetry reset at start; status + request id captured |
| `mcp/client.go` | 1071-1223 | `CallWithRequestStreamIdle` → thin wrapper (total 0 = legacy ceiling); **`CallWithRequestStreamDeadlines(req, onChunk, idle, total)`**: `context.WithTimeoutCause(total)` on a shallow copy of `HTTPClient` with `Timeout=0` (line 1126; shared Transport, shared client untouched), idle watchdog via `WithCancelCause`; `wrapStreamDeadlineErr` names the killer from `context.Cause` and appends `ctx.Err()` so the legacy "context canceled" grep survives |
| `mcp/client.go` | 1226-1268 | `CallWithRequestStreamRetry` → wrapper; **`CallWithRequestStreamRetryDeadlines`** (same retry flow; deadline kills are not retryable by construction) |
| `trader/auto_trader_planner.go` | 972-976 | planner calls `CallWithRequestStreamRetryDeadlines(req, nil, plannerStreamIdle(), plannerStreamTotal())` |
| `trader/auto_trader_planner.go` | 984-992 | on error: `🛰 planner call FAILED class=… provider_row=… model=… http_status=… request_id=… elapsed=… idle=… total=…` (row id, never the key); `🧠 planner call (…) completed in` line gains `total=%ds` |
| `trader/auto_trader_planner.go` | 1283-1302 | `plannerStreamTotal()`, `plannerClientBootLine()` (pure), `logPlannerClientBootLine()` |
| `trader/auto_trader_dayplan.go` | 74 | per-trader boot: `🛰 planner client: provider_row=<row> stream_idle=30s stream_total=1200s (AI_PLAN_TOTAL_DEADLINE_SECS) http_ceiling=600s (non-stream paths only) retries=2 backoff=2s cap=65536` |
| `trader/auto_trader.go` · `manager/trader_manager.go` | 235 · 602 | `AutoTraderConfig.AIModelID` (the ai_models row id) filled from `aiModelCfg.ID` |
| `kernel/levels_volume_boot.go` | 23-24 | `🚀 planner speed wave … stream_idle=%ds stream_total=%ds (class 37: planner ceiling split from the HTTP ceiling)` |
| `main.go` | 136-137 | `🧠 AI params in force: … timeout=600s (HTTP ceiling; non-stream paths) planner_stream_idle=30s planner_stream_total=1200s retries=2 …` |
| `web/src/guide/content/settings.ts` | 157-190 | idle entry's false sentence corrected; new knob **Planner stream total deadline** (what / evidence / consumer / range / default 1200 / when to touch) |
| `web/src/guide/content/status.ts` | 19-20 | boot ledger lines updated (`stream_total=1200s`, `🛰 planner client`) |
| `docs/superpowers/AUDIT-CHECKLIST.md` | 309-345 | **class 37** appended (36 is held by the concurrent dispatch) |

Behaviour unchanged, on purpose: `http.Client.Timeout` = 600 s still bounds every non-stream call
(executor loop, weekly read, Ask-Planner, realign) and every legacy `CallWithRequestStream` caller;
`AI_MAX_RETRIES=2`, backoff 2 s, `MaxRetryTimes` unchanged; reasoning mode / cap unchanged (owner
ruling pending); planner prompts, validators and read schedule untouched (Section F).

### Why 1200 s (C1 — from the distribution, not a blind raise)

- Successful max full/re-author attempts (n = 69): p50 447.8 s · p90 552.0 s · p95 581.1 s · max 599.5 s —
  right-censored at 600, so the true p95 is above 581 s.
- Killed attempts carried 71k-140k reasoning chars at 600 s; the largest *successful* read had 135,262
  chars in 484 s. Completion throughput on successes: p10 48.9 · p50 65.3 · p90 75.5 tok/s → the
  65,536-token planner cap is ≈ 1,000 s at the median and ≈ 1,340 s at p10.
- 1200 = 2× the observed max success; covers the cap at median throughput; the two provider-slow kills
  (K10/K11 at ~120 chars/s, 73k chars) would have needed ≈ 800-1,000 s. Anything above 1200 trades
  plan latency for completion odds — that is the owner's ruling (worst-case read wall = 3 × 1200 s = 60 min
  vs 30 min today). The knob is env-only: `AI_PLAN_TOTAL_DEADLINE_SECS=600` restores today's value with the
  new class logging (a "soft rollback" without a binary swap).
- The 30 s idle deadline is kept unchanged — candidate (b) was RULED OUT (0 idle kills; ttfb ≤ 2.2 s; the
  idle timer also covers the dial/queue phase before the first byte, as the autopsy intended).

### Tests (A8/C6 — written to fail on the old code, all green) [A]

`go test ./mcp ./kernel ./trader -count=1` → ok. Full suite `go test ./... -count=1`: first run (pre-fix
mcp) 26 ok / 1 FAIL (the 3 mcp tests fixed below); re-run on `75130d59`: see Closeout.

| Test | Pins |
|---|---|
| `mcp.TestClass37LiveStreamBeyondHTTPTimeoutSurvivesUnderTotal` | a 720 ms live stream vs `http.Client.Timeout=300ms` completes under total=5 s; the shared client's Timeout is not mutated; `request_id`/status captured; success line carries `request_id` — **fails on the pre-fix code** (Client.Timeout killed it) |
| `mcp.TestClass37LegacyIdleCallKeepsHTTPTimeoutCeiling` | total=0 path still dies at Client.Timeout, error text carries `Client.Timeout`, class `client_timeout`, `ai_call … class=client_timeout`, **not retryable** (the observed 11-kills/0-retries behaviour, pinned) |
| `mcp.TestClass37TotalDeadlineAbortsWithClass` | endless live stream dies at total=400 ms with `ErrStreamTotalDeadline`, `class=total_deadline`, no client-level retry, `LastErrClass` reads it |
| `mcp.TestClass37IdleDeadlineClass` | silent stream dies with `ErrStreamIdleDeadline`, legacy `context canceled` text preserved, `class=idle_deadline` |
| `mcp.TestClass37FailureResetsStaleTelemetry` | after a successful call, a hijack-closed transport failure reports chars=0 ttfb=0 status=0 id="" and class `transport` (the T3 defect) |
| `mcp.TestClass37ClassifyAIErrorTable` | the verbatim 08-30..09-01 journal strings → classes (both Client.Timeout shapes, both TCP-reset shapes, 429/502, no-such-host, key-not-set, bare cancel, sentinels) |
| `mcp.TestStreamIdleSilenceAborts` (existing) | still green: Go ≥1.21 returns `context.Cause` as the read error, so `wrapStreamDeadlineErr` appends `ctx.Err()` explicitly |
| `kernel.TestClass37PlannerStreamTotalDefaultAndOverride` / `…AlwaysExceedsIdle` | default 1200, idle default 30 unchanged, override 900, junk → 1200, total ≤ idle → idle + 60 |
| `trader.TestClass37PlannerClientBootLineWording` / `…StreamTotalResolvedInTrader` | boot-line tokens (row, idle, total, ceiling, retries, cap; never `sk-`), resolver reaches the trader |

Fixture note: the first version of the stale-telemetry test dialed `127.0.0.1:1` expecting an instant
refusal; on WSL2 the connect hung and the 1 s idle watchdog fired first (class `idle_deadline`). Replaced
with a hijack-and-close server — deterministic, and a reminder that the idle timer also bounds the dial.

guide keeps the old text while the drift banner shows.

Running binary (unchanged by this dispatch): `/home/hoang/nofx/nofx-bin` = `ec6632f9` (class 35, PID

### Proof (D) — the true proof has NOT yet occurred

The proof is the next max-reasoning planner read completing **past 600 s** under the new binary, or a
`class=total_deadline` line replacing today's `Client.Timeout` text. The binary is staged, not running;
no cutover was performed (A3 — owner GO required; the 16:45-17:10 window has passed but the ASIA read
chain is live). Until then the only proof is fixture-level: `TestClass37LiveStreamBeyondHTTPTimeoutSurvivesUnderTotal`
crosses a real `http.Client.Timeout` on a real TCP stream and passes only on the new code.

### What the owner will STILL see wrong (A15)

- **Until cutover:** the running `ec6632f9` still kills every max-reasoning attempt that needs > 600 s
  (`stream interrupted: context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout …)`, ~14 % of full reads), its `ai_call`
  failure lines carry no `class=`, a failed executor call can still print the previous call's
  `reasoning_chars`, and the guide drift banner shows (`GUIDE_BUILT_REV` = `75130d59` ≠ running rev).
- **After cutover:** a slow max read may legitimately run up to 20 min per attempt (60 min per 3-attempt
  read) before the plan lands — plans on the slow tail arrive later than today's 10-min kill, by design;
  lower `AI_PLAN_TOTAL_DEADLINE_SECS` or rule on reasoning effort if open−30 timing matters more.
- **Not fixed (Section F):** a deadline/transport failure is still fed to attempt 2 as a "validator
  reason" (`plannerRejectBlock`) and stored in `planner_rejected_prompts` (rows 71-72 today) — the
  offline A/B set is polluted by non-validator rows. Owner ruling requested: skip the reject block and
  tag the stored row for `class ∈ {total_deadline, idle_deadline, client_timeout, transport}`.
- **Not fixed:** `IsRetryableError` still lists the dead token "timeout" (never matches a Go
  `Client.Timeout` error) — left alone on purpose and pinned by `TestClass37LegacyIdleCallKeepsHTTPTimeoutCeiling`.
- The per-call telemetry atomics are shared by the executor and planner goroutines (pre-existing); a
  reset by one during the other's *final store→log* microsecond window could still cross — accepted.
- **Owner-side, not this dispatch:** whether the unused "DeepSeek 2" row holds a stale key (A25 — cannot
  be checked without decrypting); delete or re-key it in Settings.

## CLOSEOUT ADDENDUM (18:0x CT) — supersedes the stage/cutover commands in §Phase 2

**Owner questions answered (mid-dispatch, ~17:58 CT).** (1) The main-tree lock was taken 17:35 CT when I
moved into Phase 2 on the dispatch's evidence gate (B7 CONFIRMED + small fix), **not on owner approval** —
released 17:59:06 CT; re-acquired for ~1 s at 18:00:19 CT only to check/unstage my own binary (see below),
released again. Phase 1 itself ran lock-free and read-only. Nothing in `~/nofx` was edited by this dispatch
at any point (porcelain clean before/after; the only file I ever created there was the ignored
`nofx-bin.next`, since replaced by class 36's). (2) Phase-1 report raw URL, pinned to the Phase-1 commit:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnwick2921-cyber/nofx/638af5ed/docs/superpowers/reports/2026-09-01-planner-api-failure.md`
→ HTTP 200 (51,940 bytes); branch-tip raw URL → HTTP 200.

**Concurrency surprise (A23, reported, not acted on beyond my own branch).** While this dispatch ran, class
36 (`17efeea9` + marker `7089d271` + reports `b2c2ff92`, `a1a6e255`) landed on `dev`, and at 17:59 CT the
class-36 dispatch staged ITS binary as `~/nofx/nofx-bin.next` (sha `d2f724a9…`) — i.e. my earlier staged
file (sha `8473a5f2…`) was already gone when I went to remove it; nothing of mine remains in `~/nofx`.
PR #87 became CONFLICTING (`deploy/RELEASE`, `AUDIT-CHECKLIST.md` — both appended after class 35 —,
`web/src/guide/types.ts`). Resolution, on my branch only: merged `origin/dev` in (`e42a0b43`; checklist
keeps **36 then 37**, my "(36 is held by…)" note removed), rebuilt, re-marked.

**Combined build (36 + 37), clean clone at the merge rev [A]:**

```

**27 packages ok, 0 FAIL, EXIT=0** (e42a0b43) · frontend `npm run build` ✓ (4.35 s).
PR #87 after the push: `mergeable=MERGEABLE` (state UNSTABLE = no CI checks configured).
Commit URLs (HTTP 200): `75130d59…` (fix), `225bc367` (first marker), `dad07771` (Phase-2 report),

**Sequencing for the owner (ONE BOOT, ONE MARKER — two valid orders):**
- **(a) class 36 first, class 37 later:** cut over class 36 from its own stage per its report; afterwards
  merge PR #87 into dev (`git merge --ff-only fix/planner-stream-total-deadline` in `~/nofx` — the branch
  already contains dev), `cp ~/nofx-planner-api/nofx-bin.next ~/nofx/nofx-bin.next`, then the §Phase 2
  cutover block with `nofx-bin.old.17efeea9` and the rollback's RELEASE = `17efeea9…`.
- **(b) one combined boot:** merge PR #87 first (RELEASE becomes `e42a0b43…`), replace
  `~/nofx/nofx-bin.next` with the combined build above (it contains class 36 + 37), one cutover, one boot
  line set: `BOOT INTEGRITY OK — rev e42a0b43 · expected e42a0b43`, `planner_stream_total=1200s`,
  `🛰 planner client: …`, plus class 36's own boot line. Rollback: `printf 'ec6632f9de41060b52398f41f9ffbbf840814c40' > deploy/RELEASE`
  and `cp nofx-bin.prev.boot nofx-bin`, `kill -9 $(systemctl show -p MainPID --value nofx)`.
Either way: flat-gate quadruple + in-flight check + window first (§Phase 2), and note that at 17:53:33 CT an
ASIA read was in flight (attempt 3/3 re-author) under the running `ec6632f9`.

**Live surface right now (running ec6632f9, 17:24:00 boot):** the ASIA read at 17:38→17:47:32 CT took
532.3 s (attempt 1, parse-rejected), attempt 2 360.8 s (rejected) — both under the ceiling; the class-37
kill shape has not recurred since the cutover window, and will recur on the next > 600 s read until the
combined build runs.

**Worktree state at closeout:** `~/nofx-planner-api` on `fix/planner-stream-total-deadline` @ `3c3f5465`
(unlocked, kept for the owner's cutover; ignored `nofx-bin.next` inside), scratch clones in the session
scratchpad only. `~/nofx-main.lock`: absent.

## CUTOVER — DONE (owner GO "GO 37", 2026-09-01) [A]

**Context correction vs the closeout addendum:** class 36 was cut over by its own dispatch at 18:01:06 CT
(`🔐 BOOT INTEGRITY OK — rev 17efeea9fc59 · expected 17efeea9 · goldens PASS`, PID 1941026), so the
running binary already carried class 36 and this cutover added **class 37 only** — sequencing option (b)
in the addendum, with 36 arriving ahead of it rather than in the same boot.

**Pre-flight, all quoted fresh at 21:19:43 CT (A5/A6/A7):**

**A6 wait honoured:** at 21:13 CT a planner read WAS in flight (attempt 3/3 from 21:05:17). Per A6/class 33
the cutover waited; the attempt completed at 21:14:51 in **575.0 s** (rejected: `S4 breakdown_continue …`)
and the chain closed with `🗓️ PLAN written 2026-09-01 ASIA v3 … lifecycle no_trade` at 21:14:52. That
575.0 s attempt is one more near-miss on the old ceiling — 25 s of margin — measured on the very binary
being replaced.

Post-boot health: `✅ Trader auto-started successfully`, NinjaTrader close-sync + position-reconcile up,
executor `ai_call … ok=true` at 21:19:53, `positions snapshot count=0` at 21:20:01, **zero** error-level
lines since boot.

**Proof status (A20).** The boot is proven; the *behavioural* proof is not. It is the next max-reasoning
planner read that runs past 600 s and completes (impossible on the old binary), or an `ai_call …
class=total_deadline` line at 1200 s. Neither has occurred yet — ASIA sits on a `no_trade` plan, so the
next read is a level wake or the 01:30 CT LONDON scheduled read. **Owed evidence:** quote that line when
it lands. Until then class 37 is SHIPPED-UNPROVEN (R6: EVENT-WAIT).

**Rollback (still valid, exact):**
```
cd ~/nofx && mv nofx-bin nofx-bin.bad.e42a0b43 && cp nofx-bin.prev.boot nofx-bin \
  && printf '17efeea9fc5909473a40e60418428b521a2f1574' > deploy/RELEASE \
  && kill -9 $(systemctl show -p MainPID --value nofx) && git checkout -- deploy/RELEASE web/src/guide/types.ts
# value-only soft rollback (keeps the new class= telemetry):
echo 'AI_PLAN_TOTAL_DEADLINE_SECS=600' >> ~/nofx/.env && kill -9 $(systemctl show -p MainPID --value nofx)
```
`nofx-bin.prev.boot` = the 17efeea9 binary (class 36), also kept as `nofx-bin.old.17efeea9`.

**What the owner will still see wrong (A15), post-cutover:**
- A slow max read may now run up to 20 min per attempt (60 min for a 3-attempt read) before the plan
  lands. That is the deliberate trade: fewer fail-closed sessions, later plans on the slow tail.
- Deadline/transport failures are still fed to attempt 2 as a "validator reason" and stored in
  `planner_rejected_prompts` — unchanged by this wave (prompt paths were out of scope). Owner ruling open.
- The guide drift banner should now be CLEAR (`GUIDE_BUILT_REV` = running rev = `e42a0b43`); the FE is
  served by the vite dev server from `~/nofx/web/src`, which the merge updated, so no `dist` rebuild was
  needed.
- `~/nofx` holds 30+ historical `nofx-bin.old.*`/`.prev.*` binaries (~2 GB); unrelated to this wave, worth
  a prune.

## Appendix A — every planner attempt in the window (144 rows)

Generated from the journal by `scratch/parse_attempts2.py` (joins the `🧠 planner call` line to the preceding `ai_call`, `📊`, `🧩`/`📝` lines and the following `📐` line; the backward scan stops at the previous planner-call line). `stream` S = SSE path (post 08-31 09:39), N = non-stream. `attempt` `1?` = attempt 1 (no `🧩` line exists for attempt 1). `est_ptok` = our T2 estimate; `prov_ptok`/`ctok` = provider usage (0 on a kill — no usage frame arrives). `rchars` = reasoning chars received. `src` = `timeout_source`. Outcomes are the next `📐` line; `accepted?` = no reject line followed (the plan was written).

## LIVE EVIDENCE — first sightings of the class-37 telemetry (2026-09-01 23:47-23:53 CT) [A]

On the class-38 binary (`c0580011`, which carries class 37), one ASIA level-wake read hit three
provider-side mid-body EOFs; every failure line carried a class:

```
23:47:13 ai_call … duration_ms=250094 ok=false retries=1 ttfb_ms=510 reasoning_chars=54986 timeout_source=transport

```
Rate: 4 stream transport cuts in 81 stream calls on 2026-09-01 (4.9 per 100; 0 of 31 on 08-31; the SSE
path did not exist before 08-31 09:39). `http_status=200` on every cut — the provider accepted each
request and closed the body mid-stream. `request_id=""` — DeepSeek sent none of X-Request-Id /
Request-Id / X-Amzn-Requestid / Cf-Ray. The negotiated protocol is **HTTP/1.1** (SafeHTTPClient sets
a custom DialContext without ForceAttemptHTTP2, which disables Go's automatic h2; probed 2026-09-02
00:0x CT with a bare key-less GET: SafeHTTPClient → HTTP/1.1, stock transport → HTTP/2.0). DeepSeek's
status page showed no incident for the window.

**Class 37's own proof (a read past 600 s under the 1200 s ceiling) is still outstanding:** longest
successful read since its boot is 543.6 s; the 1200 s ceiling has not yet been needed.
