// C6: the prior-week extremes are emitted but guarded by priorWeekMinBars=4320
// on a ~33h 1m ring, so they can NEVER seat — the const block at
// levels_multiday.go:219-221 says so itself, and candidate_pool has held zero
// PWH/PWL rows ever. The const block also names the correct fix: "those anchors
// must come from a multi-day source, not the ring."
//
// So this pin does NOT assert a relaxed guard. It asserts the DAILY source.
// Relaxing the ring guard would compute a prior-week high from 33 hours of
// data, which is not a prior-week high.
