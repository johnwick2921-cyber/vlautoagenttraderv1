// KEYLEVEL-FULL-HISTORY (release #10): the 1H RTH key-level source currently
// has no lookback cap (F7) but the LIVE input cuts it to the current
// contract's last 50000 1m bars (~3.5 weeks). The store holds 1m back through
// 19 contracts (2022-04-11). The levels the mentor draws on TradingView come
// from the ACTUAL contract's own history (D3.4 frames, D5.1 p1 @18:10 + p2
// @11:20), so older contracts are stitched onto today's contract price scale
// through a MEASURED roll gap — never a guessed one.

// Roll-gap rule (CTO REL10-438-FIXES #1):
//   - The ROLL of a pair = the first session day (17:00 CT flip) on which the
//     NEWER contract has >= denseFront1mMin 1m bars (dense live/front).
//   - The gap = the median of (newer.close − older.close) over the overlapping
//     NATIVE 1h bars of the last FULL session day before the roll — the last
//     session day before the roll day with at least minRollOverlap overlapping
//     1h bars. The whole-overlap median is wrong: the spread ranges widely
//     (measured 258.25..352.25 over 1493 bars), so the gap must be read at the
//     roll boundary, not across three months.
//   - Fewer than minRollOverlap overlapping bars → no measured gap → the
//     stitch STOPS (never guess a gap).
