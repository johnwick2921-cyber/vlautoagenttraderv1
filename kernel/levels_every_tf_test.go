// per timeframe (G2/G3, 2026-08-24), but isHTFDetectionTF gated it to 15m…12h,
// so 1d/3d/1w could not reach the map at all — measured on 2026-09-10, 0 of 297
// stored plans carried a daily or weekly level.
//
// These tests pin the four things this wave changes and nothing else:
//
//	E1  a daily timeframe reaches the map, tagged tf=1d
//	E3  timeframe is part of a level's identity — same kind and price on two
//	    timeframes are TWO levels, not one dedupe casualty
//	E4  a timeframe with too few bars for the definition emits nothing AND says
//	    so — never a level from a partial window
//	C6  the tier a daily level is classified into, and the HTF flag it carries
//
// A28: this file owns ONE clock. Every bar timestamp and every `now` derives
// from tfTestNow() — a moment inside a regular session and outside every band,
// so no time predicate reads differently between two assertions.
//
// A24: no fixture retypes a production constant. Tier names, multipliers and
// the detection-gate membership are read from the code under test.
