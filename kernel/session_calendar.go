//
// SHORTENED SESSIONS ARE TRADING SESSIONS (owner ruling 2026-09-07).
//
// This replaced a boolean. isCMEHoliday() answered yes/no and the gate treated
// every holiday as a FULL closure — the old code said so itself: "for v1 we
// treat them as full closures and refuse to trade. Refine in Plan 3 if it
// becomes restrictive." On 2026-09-07 it became restrictive. MNQ traded 980
// bars across 153.50 points on Labor Day while the gate called the market shut,
// every cycle was skipped, no LONDON plan was ever read, and the 3-minute
// closed-market backoff logged 156 "overruns" against a 2-minute interval.
//
// A date is now one of three things, and the third is the one the boolean could
// not express: CLOSED, SHORTENED (trades until its stated close, then flat), or
// NORMAL (absent from the calendar — the weekly rules alone decide).
//
// THE CALENDAR IS DATA. It lives in session_calendar.json, embedded so it ships
// with the binary and cannot go missing at runtime, and every date cites a
// source that says whether it was verified or decided.
