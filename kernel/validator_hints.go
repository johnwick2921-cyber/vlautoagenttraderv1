// CLASS 34 (owner ruling 2026-08-31) — validator hints must name only legal
// conditions. Tonight both ASIA chains failed: the breakdown-void reject said
// "author a reject/retest play instead", the model authored condition
// "reject_retest", and parse/schema rejected it — the model complied with the
// hint and was punished for it. A hint is an instruction; instructions must be
// checkable. This registry pins every hint's condition tokens against the enum
// and the default shadow map (the table test IS the guard; the boot line
// re-runs it at startup).

// BreakdownReclaimedHint is the remediation phrase for a void breakdown (a
// close came back across the breakdown level).

const RepairBreakdownLaw = "BREAKDOWN-CONTINUE LAW: the breakdown is void once a close comes back across the breakdown level — author a `reject` play instead of breakdown_continue (do NOT combine condition names; `reject_retest` is not a valid condition)."

// RepairArmSplitLaw is the ARM-SPLIT law excerpt for repair prompts.
const RepairArmSplitLaw = "ARM-SPLIT LAW: a scenario with a split contract arm needs EXACTLY 2 legs — leg 1 rests AT the sweep ref with confirm=touch at the sweep ref; leg 2 is 1m_mss (1x5m_close accepted as the leg-2 alternative). Only sweep_reclaim conditions arm split; every other condition arms a SINGLE leg."

// RepairEntryConfirmLaw is the ENTRY-LAW CONFIRM excerpt for repair prompts.
const RepairEntryConfirmLaw = "ENTRY-LAW CONFIRM LAW: breakdown_continue takes 1 confirming close + displacement >= BD_MIN_DISP_ATR x ATR5m OR stop-entry (E7); 2x5m_close is legal ONLY there. confirm2 mirrors confirm1 unless the law above allows it."

// RepairConfirmVocabLaw (REPAIR-PARSE, 2026-09-02) is the excerpt for a
// rejected confirm/confirm2 RULE TOKEN. It is the single most common repair
// defect: 10 of 18 repair rejections in the 2026-09-01 journals were a confirm
// rule token that does not exist in that field's enum ("2x5m", "displacement")
// or a token illegal for that condition. Before this the repair prompt routed
// those to a generic excerpt about level labels and targets — the model was
// told it was wrong and never told the legal words. Class 38's rule holds: the
// confirm enum and the death/flip enum are SEPARATE vocabularies and are named
// as such, never as one list of bare tokens.
const RepairConfirmVocabLaw = "CONFIRM-RULE VOCABULARY: the `confirm.rule` and `confirm2.rule` fields take EXACTLY one of touch | 1x5m_close | 2x5m_close | 1m_mss | time_hold. The death/flip `rule` field is a DIFFERENT vocabulary (2x5m | 5m_close) — a token from it is INVALID in confirm/confirm2, and words like `displacement` are not tokens in either. Re-spell the rejected token as one of the five confirm values that matches the play."

// RepairFlipDirectionLaw (W-FLIP-DIRECTION, 2026-09-17) is the excerpt for a
// flip whose side points the wrong way for the bias it flips from. LONDON v3
// (2026-09-17) shipped bias short + flip{below → long}; the number matched the
// prose and nothing asked the direction. The model is told the law it is
// judged by, in the words the validator uses.
const RepairFlipDirectionLaw = "FLIP DIRECTION: flip side must oppose the bias: short bias flips long on a close ABOVE; long bias flips short on a close BELOW. `flip.side` is the side of the line price must CLOSE on for the bias to reverse — a short bias with `flip.side: below` can never flip on a rally. Fix the side (or the flip_to), never the death object."

// RepairFlipSideOfPriceLaw (W-FLIP-LINE-SIDE-OF-PRICE, 2026-09-17) is the
// excerpt for a flip or death line that already sits beyond price on its own
// side. ASIA v2 (2026-09-17 22:52 CT) shipped bias short + flip{29747.50 above
// → long} with price 29764: the direction matched the bias and nothing asked
// where price was. The touch gate fires a line only from the near side after
// birth, so that flip could never fire. The model is told the law in the
// validator's words.
const RepairFlipSideOfPriceLaw = "LINE SIDE OF PRICE: a flip line must sit on the far side of price at authoring — `flip.side: above` needs the line ABOVE the current price, `flip.side: below` needs it BELOW. The machine fires a line only after price touches it from the near side and then closes beyond it, so a line already beyond price on its own side can never be touched from the near side and never fires; the death line obeys the same law (a death line already crossed is a plan born dead). Move the line to the far side of the current price (keep the side the bias requires); never flip the bias to satisfy it."

// RepairInvalidationGrammarLaw (W-EXEC-TRUTH W2 A1, 2026-09-23) is the excerpt
// for the combined grammar refusal. Row 455 authored "Any 5m close above
// 31075.75 invalidates the fade; stand aside for the breakout." — accepted as
// UNKNOWN before this wave. The model is told the grammar in the forms the
// validator parses; the sentence is prose, so only 2x5m is a scanned token.
const RepairInvalidationGrammarLaw = "INVALIDATION GRAMMAR: every scenario's `invalid` is machine-checked at write and must be EXACTLY one of `5m close above <price>` | `5m close below <price>` | `2x5m close above <price>` | `2x5m close below <price>` — one plain number and nothing else (no `any`, `back`, `then`, no second clause, no other timeframe). A sentence outside the grammar is REFUSED, never accepted. Rewrite each quoted line into one of the four forms, keeping its price and side; change nothing else."

// Class 38 rows 78 → 79: a confirm-field instruction named the death/flip
// spelling, the model copied it into confirm2.rule, and the schema rejected it.
