// CLASS 38 (2026-09-01) — THE PROMPT/VALIDATOR CONTRACT.
//
// The defect class: the prompt offers or names something the validator
// rejects. reject_retest (class 34), the bare "2x5m" confirm token, and the
// unqualified "legs" schema field are all instances. The model is not the
// defect; the contract is.
//
// This registry is the machine-checkable half of that contract. Every
// validator branch that restricts a field BY CONDITION is listed here with the
// sentence(s) the rendered prompt must carry. ValidatePromptContracts asserts
// the sentences are present — "validator forbids X" without "prompt says X is
// forbidden" fails the build (table test) and shouts at boot.
//
// Add a row whenever a condition-keyed restriction is added to the validator.
// The list is deliberately literal: it is a contract, not a heuristic.

// PromptContract is one validator restriction and the prompt text that states
// it to the author.
