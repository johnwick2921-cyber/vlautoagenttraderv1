// five times in a row that way — v1..v5 each held 6 perfectly good levels
// (EQL 30199.5 / ONH 30203 / ONL 30166.25 …) clustered in a ~57pt band that the
// session had obviously traded through earlier — until the re-plan budget ran out
// and writeNoTradePlan stored a levels:null NO-TRADE plan. The card then showed
// "No levels in this plan", which is what the owner saw on "every version".
//
// It is latent whenever the cache is thin and fires the moment real history
// arrives, which is exactly what happened when the weekend bar-starvation
// (AddOn watchdog livelock, 7aa521a1) ended and 2000 bars/TF were seeded.
