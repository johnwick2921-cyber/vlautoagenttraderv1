// ── CLASS 48 — ONE ENTRY GATE FOR BOTH ORDER PATHS ──────────────────────────
//
// The five entry protections (R:R floor, shadow map 0C, scenario-direction
// consistency, min-SL ×ATR5m, one-live-arm) historically lived ONLY at the arm
// seam (armed_executor.go) while the decision path (auto_trader_orders.go →
// OpenLong market entry) ran a different, thinner chain and the agent chat
// path ran almost none. Live proof 2026-09-02: positions 587/589 filled BELOW
// the owner's 2.0 R:R floor at the real fill (the floor had been evaluated
// against the prompt-time snapshot), and 589/590 traded the SHADOWED condition
// breakout_retest, and 590 opened long citing a scenario that other versions
// authored short — all three admitted by the decision path.
//
// EntryGate is THE one canonical check. Both seams call it before any order
// leaves. The callers resolve every input (the function itself is pure and
// testable): the arm seam feeds arm-leg prices, the decision path feeds the
// LIVE market price at execution time (which is what actually fixes the
// snapshot mismatch — the floor is now judged at the price the order will
// transact at).
//
// Fail-open contract (mirrors validateDecision): a leg whose input is missing
// (no market price, no ATR, no plan, no shadow resolver) SKIPS. The gate
// refuses only on POSITIVE evidence, never on absence of evidence.

// EntryIntent is the resolved input to EntryGate.
