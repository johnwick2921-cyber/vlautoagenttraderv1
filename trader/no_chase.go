// ── NO-CHASE (2026-09-02) — entries must be near the level they cite ────────
// Evidence, 09-02 losses forensic: four longs, four stops, −$381.50, on a day
// the market went UP (29048 → 29192 by 09:41). The BIAS was right. Positions
// 587/588 entered near 29080 and were stopped on a 30-pt dip; price then ran
// 140 pts without the bot. Positions 589 and 590 entered at 29192.50 and
// 29193.25 — AFTER that rally, at the local top — and were stopped on 50-80 pt
// pullbacks. Their MFE was 10.25 and 1.00: they never went in favour at all.
//
// The entry gate measures R:R at the fill and refuses a late entry whose
// TARGET has shrunk. It does not ask how far the entry sits from the level the
// scenario cites, nor how far price has already travelled since that level was
// touched. A chase with a still-plausible R:R passes every existing leg.
//
// WARN-FIRST BY DESIGN (A24): this leg refuses NOTHING. It measures, logs and
// counts. A week of counts is the research; the owner then rules on promotion
// against the criterion pre-registered in the report.

// known" and the leg abstains rather than inventing a distance.
