// U1 (stale-bar dispatch 2026-08-19) — FEED PROBLEMS BECOME LOUD.
//
// The 08-19 00:53 VM reboot took the NT8 wire down for ~50 minutes and the only
// symptoms were mystery artifacts: planner fail-closed rows ("scenarios count 0
// invalid") from LLM calls made with NO market data, and an empty chart. The
// forensics filed it as U1: feed loss must announce itself, and the planner
// must refuse to spend an API call on an empty window.

// feedDownAfter() — B2 (T6): the flat-state threshold now comes from the ONE
// feed policy (kernel.LoadFeedPolicy, env FEED_ALERT_S, default 600s — the
// same 10 minutes as before, env-tunable and shared with the B4 fallback).
