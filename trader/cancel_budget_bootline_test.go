//
// Why it earns a clause rather than a report footnote: a reader who sees
// "rerequest-cap=5" has no way to tell whether that budget is per row forever
// (the defect) or per process (the fix). Both render identically. The line has
// to name WHICH, and it has to name the carry — how many rows in this ledger
// were counted by a process that is gone, i.e. how many will reset on their next
// request. Zero of those is the normal, quiet case and must read as a measured
// zero, not as an uncomputed one (A24).
