// ── D2 — THE STORE IS THE HORIZON; THE RING IS THE CACHE ────────────────────
// (owner ruling, wave BARS HORIZON 2026-09-09)
//
// Three call sites asked for depth NO MARKET CONDITION COULD SUPPLY. The ring
// ceiling is DefaultBarCacheMaxBars = 2500 per (symbol, timeframe)
// (provider/ninjatrader/bar_cache.go:24), and a Go restart rebuilds it from a
// 2000-bar seed (defaultAutoBarsBack, tcp_server.go):
//
//	auto_trader_planner.go   1m × 12000 = 200.0 h  vs a 41.7 h ceiling
//	auto_trader_weekly.go    1m × 12000 = 200.0 h  vs a 41.7 h ceiling
//	auto_trader_planner.go   5m ×  3000 = 250.0 h  vs a 208.3 h ceiling
//
// The store held the depth the whole time and was wired to nothing:
// market.FuturesBarsProvider has ONE production assignment
// (trader/ninjatrader/bars_market_bridge.go) and it reads the BarCache only.
//
// CHOICE PER CALLER, recorded at the call site itself:
//   - the two 1m sites take (a) READ THE STORE — a candle table promising 8
//     session-days needs ~11,040 open minutes and the store has 21 days of them;
//   - the 5m site takes (b) CORRECT THE ASK AND STOP PROMISING 20 DAYS — see
//     rvBaseline5mBarsAsk in auto_trader_planner.go for why (a) was refused there.
//
// A10: this never gates, refuses, blocks or blanks. Every failure path returns
// what the ring returned, which is exactly the pre-wave value.
//
// ── KNOWN LIMITATION: THE STORE IS CONTRACT-BLIND (raised in review,
// 2026-09-09; NOT fixed here, because the wire and the AddOn are out of this
// wave's footprint). ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `.schema bars` (read 2026-09-09): PRIMARY KEY (symbol, tf, open_time_ms) —
// there is no contract/expiry column, and CLAUDE.md keeps the "MNQ 06-26" form
// inside the C# GetInstrument call only. So a stored MNQ 1m bar does not say
// WHICH contract it came from.
//
// WHAT THAT MEANS AFTER A QUARTERLY ROLL: the ring is the new contract while
// the store's older rows are the old one, and rule 3 admits those rows PRECISELY
// BECAUSE they are older. The quarterly basis on MNQ is tens of points, so the
// seam renders as a real price step in the 8-session daily table for as long as
// the pre-roll rows remain the deepest history — with no marker, because a
// contract change is not a missing bar and D1 measures presence, not identity.
//
// THE HAZARD PRE-EXISTS THIS WAVE (SeedHistorical merges, so a roll's old bars
// linger in the ring too) but its reach was 41.7 h; D2 extends it to the 1m
// retention window (90 days; 21 days held today). The next MNQ roll is the
// September→December contract. A later wave should persist the resolved contract
// per bar and MARK — never drop — a splice across a contract boundary.

// barsWithStoreDepth serves a bar request the ring alone cannot fill, by
// EXTENDING it backwards from the store. `now` comes from the caller (A28).

//     or the AddOn seed has not landed; handing a planner 12,000 stored bars
//     would let it write a plan on a dead tape, which is the exact failure
//     "no NT8 → no decisions" exists to prevent. The store DEEPENS a live tape;
//     it never stands in for one.
//  2. A RING THAT ALREADY SERVES THE ASK IS NOT SECOND-GUESSED — no store read
//     at all, so the ~29 healthy call sites pay nothing.
//  3. ONLY BARS STRICTLY OLDER THAN THE RING'S OLDEST ARE TAKEN. A live bar is
//     never replaced by a stored one, so the freshest OHLCV always wins and the
//     forming bar survives untouched.
//  4. A FAILED OR EMPTY STORE READ DEGRADES TO THE RING, loudly (A9/A10).
//
// The result is ascending by open time, tail-capped at n, and byte-identical to
// the pre-wave value whenever the store adds nothing.
