// B3 — duplicate-order guard + rate limiter. Two structural protections at the
// order-submission chokepoint:
//   - DUPE GUARD: an identical order action (idempotence key: account|side|symbol|
//     qty) repeated within ~one bar is DROPPED — a replayed / double-fired signal
//     can never place a second order in the same bar.
//   - RATE LIMITER: if more than orderRateMax order-actions fire within
//     orderRateWindow, a breaker trips and halts new actions (🚨) until the window
//     drains — a runaway loop can't machine-gun the broker.

const (
	orderDedupWindowMs = 55_000 // drop an identical order within ~1 (1-minute) bar

// reserve is B3's CHECK, split from its COMMIT (W1b E12(b)). It reports whether
// an order action with the given idempotence key may proceed at nowMs; ok==false
// → the action MUST be dropped, and reason says why (duplicate or rate breaker).
//
// On ok the key is only RESERVED: the caller MUST call done exactly once (a
// deferred call is the pattern). done(true) — the send was attempted — records
// the key and the action, and the dedupe window and the rate breaker count it;
// done(false) — refused or aborted before the wire — releases the reservation
// and records NOTHING. Before this split the key was recorded at admit, so a
// refusal after B3 (the ledger registration, a missing bracket, the maintenance
// hold at the flush) burned the 55 s window and the legitimate retry of an
// order that never reached the broker was dropped as its "duplicate".
//
// Fail-closed while reserved: the same key is refused as a duplicate until done
// runs, and a reservation counts toward the rate breaker, so a concurrent
// caller cannot slip a second identical order through the check/commit gap.
// Consequence named for the record: the breaker now counts SENT actions (plus
// reservations in flight), not admitted ones.
