// ── D3 — THE RING REHYDRATES FROM THE STORE ON BOOT ─────────────────────────

//
// A Go restart drops the ring to the AddOn's 2000-bar seed
// (defaultAutoBarsBack) while the persisted `bars` table holds 21 days
// (measured 2026-09-09: MNQ 1m 20,043 rows back to 2026-08-19 10:00 CT). The
// ring climbs back to 2500 across a session because SeedHistorical MERGES —
// and then the next restart shortens the horizon again. Nothing ever
// rehydrated it.
//
// This runs ALONGSIDE the AddOn's seed, immediately after the replay lands, and
// it deliberately touches nothing else: not the AddOn, not the subscription,
// not the backfill.
//
// EVERY CONSTRAINT IS ENFORCED BY RehydrateOlder, not here:
//   - it MERGES (mergeBarsByTime, the same discipline SeedHistorical uses);
//   - it never replaces a live bar with a stale one (older-only, existing wins);
//   - it is bounded by the ring's own maxBars;
//   - it is a NO-OP on a cold key, so a dead feed can never be made to look alive.
//
// 1m ONLY — OWNER CONDITION (a), RULING 2026-09-09 18:18 CT.
//
//	"RULING on D3: the regime input MAY change. Rehydrating the ring from the
//	 store changes what RVBaseline is fed — and what it is fed today is 41
//	 hours labelled as 20 days. A regime value computed on a shorter window
//	 than its name is the defect; correcting the window is not a scope
//	 violation, it is the fix. A31 forbids changing the RULE, not correcting
//	 the INPUT the rule was promised."
//
// The first cut rehydrated EVERY (symbol, timeframe) pair the cache held. That
// deepened the 5m ring from the AddOn's ~2000-bar seed to the 2500 cap, and
// min5Long (auto_trader_planner.go) was the ONE production ring read above
// 2000 — so it moved a REGIME input using NT8's own 5m aggregates. MEASURED on
// the live store, MNQ, kernel.RVBaselineFrom5mDays(·, 20, 5):
//
//	stored 5m, newest 2000 rows → 0.876371 over 7 complete session-days
//	stored 5m, newest 2500 rows → 0.884746 over 9 complete session-days
//	1m tape 12000 → agg 5m 2400 → 0.893543 over 9 complete session-days
//
// The last two cover the SAME nine days and disagree by 0.9%: the stored 5m
// rows do not agree with their own 1m constituents (store/bar_history.go's
// migration once deleted every non-1m row for exactly that reason). So the
// rehydrate takes the 1m rows ONLY — the feed's own closed bars, the tape every
// other series is aggregated FROM — and the deeper regime window is served from
// that 1m tail instead (owner condition (b): ResolveRVBaselineTape,
// trader/regime_input_window.go). The non-1m rings keep exactly what the AddOn
// seeded, exactly as before the wave.
//
// THIS WAVE DOES MOVE COMPUTED VALUES, AND THE REPORT NAMES THEM. Claiming
// otherwise while the boot line shows a change is class 82. What moves:
// RVBaseline / RVBaselineDays (7 → 9 complete session-days), and — through the
// D2 1m store splice, not through this rehydrate — CompletedWeekCount (0 → 2)
// and WeeklyShadowRefs (1 → 3). The RULE (kernel.RVBaselineFrom5mDays) is
