// W117 slice A (F2) — the owning trader's durable execution consumers ride the
// server's per-(symbol,account) ordered worker, in TCP receive order. The
// worker calls exactly these three closures; the legacy advisory consumers
// skip frames the worker owns (OrderedOwned), so nothing is double-applied.
//
// Lifecycle (R5): InstallOrderedExecutions is called from AutoTrader.Run —
// never from NewTCPTrader — and the returned closure MUST be called on Stop.
// A second LIVE registration for the same (symbol, account) is refused loudly
// by the server (two traders on one account would double-apply the same
// fills); the refusal is an error here, not a silent eviction.

// InstallOrderedExecutions wires this trader's durable consumers into the
// server's ordered-execution worker for its (symbol, account) owner. The
// returned func unregisters them (idempotent; call on Stop).
