// replayHold keeps a replay's rows OUT of the store until the ring has judged
// the replay against the first live bar that follows it.
//
// WHY A SECOND DOOR. The upsert rule stops a replay from overwriting a live
// row. It does nothing for a minute no live bar ever wrote — a restart gap,
// the seconds between a reconnect and its first live bar. A replay on the
// wrong scale (the 2026-09-10 finding: facts 16516009 vs 16518205, ~290 pts
// apart for the same minute) filled those minutes with rows on another price
// scale, labelled 'historical', and every later boot's rehydrate would have
// carried them back into the ring as the oldest bars it holds. So the store
// never receives a replay row until the ring's SeedVerdict says the replay
// and the live feed agree; an off-scale replay is discarded here and said so
// once.
//
// The cost is honest: a minute only the replay saw stays EMPTY in the store
// until a replay on the live scale arrives. An empty minute reads as a gap;
// a wrong-scale minute reads as the largest move of the day.
