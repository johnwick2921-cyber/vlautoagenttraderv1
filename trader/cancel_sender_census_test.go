// EVERY CANCEL SENDER IS GUARDED (2026-09-07, D4).
//
// The 09-06 wave guarded seven cancel sites in armed_executor.go and missed two
// others that send the identical frame — cancelOtherArmsInPlan and the class-27
// desync sweep. Nothing caught that, because each site was reviewed on its own.
//
// So the pin is a CENSUS, not a list: it finds every call that puts a
// cancel_order on the wire and requires a guard in the same function. A new
// sender added next month fails this without anyone remembering to add it here.

// cancelSendRe matches a cancel going to the NT8 trader. The CEX/DEX brokers
// take (symbol, orderID) and are a different method on a different interface;
// this one takes a single signal id.
//
// It deliberately does NOT require a following "(": the first draft did, and
// routing a sender through cancelSignalIfSafeWith(nt.CancelOrder, ...) — passing
// the method as a VALUE — dropped it out of the census entirely. The count fell
// from 8 to 7 and the pin went green partly by going blind. A censor that stops
// seeing what it censors is worse than none.
// THE SUBJECT IS THE RAW WIRE, not the seam. Matching `cancelFn(` instead was
// wrong in both directions: it missed the two dispatchers that hand the raw
// method down unguarded, and it flagged reconcileStaleWorking and
// confirmPendingCancels, which receive a closure that has ALREADY adjudicated
// (armed_executor.go:1088 and :1099). So: every reference to the NT8 trader's
// CancelOrder — called or passed as a value — must sit in a function that
// guards, or delegate to one that does.

	//
	// The census found these two beyond the two the owner named, and guarding
	// them was tried and REVERTED. The guard refuses when there is no broker
	// book, and on these two paths refusing is the MORE dangerous failure:
	//
	//   cancelArmedOrdersSyncWith is what flattens at session close and on a
	//   news halt. A refusal there leaves live arms standing into an EOD
	//   flatten or a news event. (TestSListEODFlatCancelsArmsBeforeFlatten and
	//   TestT1NewsFlatTraderArmCancelled both went red when it was guarded.)
	//
	//   sweepPreBootArmsWith retires orders orphaned by a dead process. A
	//   refusal leaves them resting — the class-33 double-order of 2026-09-02
	//   00:16 CT. It already has its OWN answer to a missing link: it DEFERS
	//   without latching and retries next cycle, which is the same
	//   conservatism expressed where it belongs.
	//
	// And the harm the Go guard exists to prevent is fixed at its source by
	// D1: HandleCancelOrder no longer touches placedBrackets, so a cancel can
	// no longer reach a protective order however it is sent. The Go guard is
	// defence in depth on the paths where refusing is cheap; these are not
	// those paths. Named here rather than silently passing, so the trade is
	// visible to whoever reads this next.
