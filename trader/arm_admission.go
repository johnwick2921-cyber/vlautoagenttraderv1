// gates. Proven by execution before this wave: a daily_force_flat refusal and
// a limit placement for the SAME leg in ONE pass. The authoring loop now
// records the legs whose every gate passed THIS pass (armAdmission) and the
// placement places only those. Then admitEntry — the one admission chain —
// runs for the row at its send point.

// armAdmission is the set of legs this pass's authoring gates admitted, keyed
// plan|scenario|leg (version-insensitive: the row's version is refreshed each
// pass by the authoring loop).
