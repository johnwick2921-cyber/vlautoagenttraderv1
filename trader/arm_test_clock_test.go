// armTestClock returns a moment that is inside an ENABLED session window and
// outside EVERY no-trade sub-window, so an arm-path test asserts the arm path
// rather than the hour the suite happened to run at.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-10 dev's Go suite was 31 ok / 0 fail at 11:26 and
// 11:58 and RED at 12:11 — eight trader/ tests, one machine, one commit, one
// install, nothing touched. The clock had crossed 12:00 and entered the lunch
// no-trade band the session-risk wave added:
//
//	🛑 arm REFUSED (session risk): no_trade_band: lunch no-trade window (12:00–13:30 CT)
//
// It would have gone green again at 13:30 with nobody doing anything, which is
// worse than staying red: a cutover in that 90-minute window reads a red suite
// and blames its own branch.
//
// THE SEAM WAS NOT MISSING — the tests simply did not use it. A28 is already
// honoured in production: maybeManageArmedOrders() takes time.Now() at the entry
// and delegates to maybeManageArmedOrdersAt(snap, now), and every rule beneath
// takes the clock as an argument. The tests called the WALL-CLOCK entry point and
// handed a correctly-seamed rule the real hour of the day. clock-seams.list's own
// header describes exactly this ("the entry owns the clock; the rule takes it as
// an argument", class 60), and trader/clock_seam_lint_test.go asserts the seam
// EXISTS but never that the tests USE it. A seam only the production path honours
// is half a seam.
//
// The search is deliberate rather than a fixed constant: session windows and the
// no-trade bands are configuration and move. Scanning asks the registry what is
// true instead of hard-coding an hour that a later config change would silently
// invalidate — which would be this same defect with a longer fuse.

// armTestClockFrom is the same search from a CALLER-CHOSEN base.
//
// Pass a FIXED base when the test's fixtures are sensitive to the absolute
// value of the clock rather than merely to being inside a session — bar bucket
// boundaries are the case that bit: a tape whose confirm depends on the last
// five 1m bars forming a complete 5m bucket means the tape's meaning depends on
// `now` MODULO 5 MINUTES, and searching from time.Now() moves that modulus
// through the day. Fixed base, fixed modulus, same answer every run.
