// ── CANCEL-CONFIRMATION (2026-09-06) ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE DEFECT, IN ONE SENTENCE: a send is not a settlement.
//
// nt.CancelOrder is a one-line pass-through to SendCancelOrder
// (trader/ninjatrader/tcp_trader.go:558-562); its error is the result of PUTTING
// A FRAME ON A SOCKET. Five call sites in armed_executor.go treated `cerr == nil`
// as proof the order was gone and wrote the ledger `cancelled` on the strength of
// it (:342, :447, :490, :517, :837), and the sync helper wrote `cancelled` even
// on ACK TIMEOUT (:1933, "flatten proceeds"). So the ledger could say cancelled
// while the order still rested at the broker — which is exactly what
// nt8_order_snapshots id 1664 recorded: NINE working stop orders for ONE arm slot
// (2026-09-04:NY v3 S2 leg 0 SHORT), against nine ledger rows all reading
// 'cancelled'. They were harmless only because the order was malformed and inert.
//
// THE RULE (A20, class 6): a cancel is proven by the ORDER'S ABSENCE FROM A FRESH
// BROKER SNAPSHOT. Never by a return value, never by a log line, never by a
// ledger row. This file is the adjudication, kept PURE so a test can drive every
// branch with a real book; the clock is the caller's (A28).
//
// SIBLING TO class 79 (the reaper: silence is not death) and class 33 (the boot
// sweep). Their shared shape: an ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE is not evidence of absence.

// slotAction is what the adjudicator decided. It is deliberately not a bool:
// "allowed" and "refused because we cannot see" must not collapse together.
