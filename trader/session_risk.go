// ── SESSION RISK LIMITS (2026-09-09, dispatch 104) ───────────────────────────
//
// Two gates that existed but did not guard the path that trades.
//
// THE BREAKER. consecutive_loss_halt has been wired since D1 — on the DECISION
// path only (auto_trader_orders.go). Under plan_mode=strict the decision path
// cannot enter at all ("plan_mode=strict executes plan scenarios on the ARM
// path only", entry_gate.go), so the circuit breaker guarded a door nobody
// walks through. Unlike the daily limit it is NOT gated by the guardrails
// master, so it is the one session limit that can actually bite today.
//
// THE NO-TRADE BAND. Same shape, found the same day: lunch and first-N are
// enforced at auto_trader_orders.go:281 and NOWHERE else — armed_executor.go
// contained zero references to InLunchNoTrade, InFirstNoTradeMinutes or
// sessionEntryBlocked. An arm could be placed at 12:15 CT, inside the band the
// rest of the system believes is closed.
//
// THRESHOLDS ARE LABELLED, NOT MEASURED. The research establishes session risk
// limits as a REQUIREMENT and does not establish the NUMBERS. N and M are [I]
// until the record says otherwise, and they ride the boot line so the owner
// reads what is actually enforced rather than what a doc claims.
//
// MEASURED ON THIS TAPE (n=73 usable era closes, 2026-08-15→2026-09-09):
// the longest losing run is SEVEN (ids 585-591). N=8 therefore NEVER FIRES on
// this tape — it sits one above the observed maximum, the same shape as the
// $450 daily limit that trips 0 of 12 days. M=5 does fire. Both facts are in
// the report; neither is hidden behind a default.

const (
	// breakerHaltDefault — N. vet-06's [I] proposal (8 of the last 10 losing).
