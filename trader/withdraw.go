// ── W-EXEC-TRUTH W0 (f) — WITHDRAW RESTING ENTRIES, ENTRIES ONLY ────────────
//
// A hold used to REFUSE new entries only: a resting armed limit or stop kept
// resting and could FILL during an update. And a loss-limit trip (the
// consecutive-loss breaker, the daily force-flat) refused new entries too,
// while an entry already resting at NT8 could still fill after the halt
// (defect 7 — money safety, CTO Q14).
//
// withdrawEntriesIfDue runs from monitorTick — the per-trader wall-clock beat
// that keeps running when runCycle does not (CME closed, EOD flat, a stopped
// scan) — whenever something asks for a withdraw:
//
//	maintenance  a hold written with --withdraw-entries (never implied)
//	breaker      the consecutive-loss halt has tripped
//	force-flat   the daily force-flat has tripped
//
// It cancels ENTRIES ONLY: every armed row that carries a broker signal and
// is not terminal, through the same filled-arm guard (cancelSafetyFor) and the
// AddOn's entry-only cancel_order; the row goes to cancel_pending. A pending
// cancel is NEVER shown as complete: it becomes 'cancelled' only on received
// evidence — an order_update, or the order's absence from a fresh PERSISTED
// snapshot (confirmPendingCancels). Protection, reconciliation and exits are
// never touched. An arm with no signal was never sent: it stays armed and the
// admission gate refuses it.
//
// ARMED rows are the complete set of resting entries: Picture never rests an
// entry (its send is a market order — it fills or is refused, it does not
// wait at a price), and the AI path's entries are market orders too.

// WithdrawReasonPrefix marks a withdraw in the ledger's state_reason. The
// store owns it: every later lifecycle write APPENDS to a withdrawn row's
// reason after store.WithdrawReasonSep instead of replacing it, so the view
// below still finds the row after a re-request, an order_update or a
// snapshot confirm (store.reasonKeepingWithdraw).
