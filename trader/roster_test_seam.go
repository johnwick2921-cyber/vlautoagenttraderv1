package trader

// NewAutoTraderOnBrokerForTest builds a minimal AutoTrader over broker for
// ANOTHER package's call-site test (W1b FOLD-5 repair, canon 53): the agent's
// chat-door resolver reads the manager's roster of *AutoTrader through its
// production adapter (managedTradeCandidate → GetStatus / GetExchange /
// GetUnderlyingTrader), and a test there cannot build one any other way
// without NewAutoTrader's process-wide side effects (the NT8 listener, the AI
// client, the bar/level sinks). It carries no store, no AI client and no
// loop; running only sets the flag GetStatus reports. Never called in
// production.
