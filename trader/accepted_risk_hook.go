// ── WAVE A / D4 — RECORDING WHAT THE BROKER ACCEPTED ─────────────────────────
//
// NT8 sends an order_update the moment it accepts an order, and the AddOn fires
// an order_snapshot on the SAME state change (VLTraderTCPClient.cs:1600), so the
// broker's own prices are in hand at exactly the instant we need them. Until
// now the acceptance event was received and dropped: onArmedOrderUpdate handled
// filled / partfilled / rejected / cancelled and had NO case for "accepted".
//
// CLASS 23 / A10 GOVERNS THIS FILE. It is telemetry. It writes one row and
// decides nothing — a panic, a stale book or a locked database WARNs and the
// trading loop continues.

// recordAcceptedRisk appends the immutable record of an accepted order. It is
// called once per acceptance; a re-authorization appends ANOTHER row rather
// than editing this one, so ledger drift becomes a query.
