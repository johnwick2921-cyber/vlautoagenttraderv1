// ITEM 3 (2026-08-17) — THE OWNER'S MANUAL ESCAPE HATCH.
//
// The planner only reads on its own schedule and on death. When a plan is wrong
// but not dead — or the owner has just learned something the plan does not know —
// there was no way to ask for a fresh read short of waiting. This is that button.
//
// It SPENDS one re-plan from the same budget the automatic path uses, so it can
// never be used to talk the bot past its own limits, and the new version is
// written through the NORMAL path with trigger_reason "owner_reread" so the
// history shows who asked.

// RereadRefusal explains why a manual re-read is not available, in the owner's
// language. Empty Reason means it IS available.
