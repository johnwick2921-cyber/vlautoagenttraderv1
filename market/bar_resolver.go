// ── BAR-SOURCE WAVE (2026-09-02) — ONE RESOLVER ─────────────────────────────
// Before this there was no single answer to "give me completed <tf> bars".
// Two unconnected layers existed — the NT8 BarCache (native per-TF, memory
// only) and the SQLite `bars` table (1m only) — plus four hand-rolled 1m→TF
// aggregators. The weekly reader built weeks from the 1m table, which starts
// 2026-08-19, so it saw TWO completed weeks and rendered "thin · low" while
// the cache held 383 native weekly bars back to 2019-05-03 (measured live on
// 0465a10b, 2026-09-02). This file is the one door.
//
// THREE-DEEP LADDER (owner ruling 2026-09-02), encoded as DATA, not as
// special cases: native TF → aggregate from the next native TF down → own-1m
// last. For weekly that is 1w → 1d → 1m, and own-1m should never be reached.

// BarSource names where a resolved series came from. It travels WITH the bars
// so no caller has to guess, and so a mixed answer is impossible.
