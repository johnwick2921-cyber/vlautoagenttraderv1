// ── ROLL WAVE (2026-09-10) — THE CURRENT CONTRACT IS ONE VALUE FROM ONE SOURCE ─
//
// The AddOn resolves the front month by a UTC date rule (VLContractResolver.cs
// :80, expiry minus eight days) and re-subscribes on reconnect. On 2026-09-10 the
// rule flipped at 19:00 CT; the wire changed at the 21:15:03 CT reconnect, when
// the subscription ACK named "MNQ 12-26" where the previous one had named
// "MNQ 09-26". Nothing on the Go side noticed: the ring kept ~2,000 September
// bars and appended December ones, and a ~292-point step presented to every
// reader as a move.
//
// The rule now: the contract is whatever the AddOn's MOST RECENT RECEIVED frame
// named. That frame is the `subscribed` ACK — the hello carries only build_id,
// and bar frames carry no instrument at all (C4). A date rule is exactly the
// defect this replaces and is never consulted (A24).

// ContractFact is the current contract with its provenance: the frame that
// named it and when that frame was received (the four-clock rule — a fact
// carries its observation and its receipt time, and names its source).

	Previous   string    // the contract before the last roll ("" if never rolled this process)
	RolledAt   time.Time // zero if no roll observed this process

// symbol. ok=false means NO frame has named one this process — the caller
