// ── ONE ORDER-STATE VOCABULARY (2026-09-07, D3) ──────────────────────────────
//
// Before this file the tree classified broker order states in four unrelated
// places, each answering a narrower question than its callers assumed:
//
//   provider/ninjatrader/order_snapshot.go  a terminal SET, "not terminal" = working
//   trader/accepted_risk_hook.go            a dying SET, four spellings, inline
//   trader/armed_executor.go                a switch on two live spellings
//   ninjascript/VLTraderTCPClient.cs        `st != Working && st != Accepted`
//
// Two of them were wrong, and wrong in the direction that costs money.
//
//   (a) TriggerPending appeared NOWHERE in the tree — 0 occurrences across
//       every .go and .cs file, measured 2026-09-07. NinjaTrader holds such an
//       order on the LOCAL PC; it is not at the exchange and will not fire if
//       the machine is down. Falling through the terminal set, it read as an
//       ordinary live order, so a stop that existed only on this desktop
//       counted as protection.
//
//   (b) `unknown` sat in the terminal set beside `filled` and `cancelled`, so
//       an order whose state we could not READ was classified as an order that
//       no longer EXISTS. Owner ruling, 2026-09-07: "an unreadable state is not
//       history. UNKNOWN is non-terminal and takes no destructive branch; a
//       cancel or a reconciliation that meets it does nothing and logs."
//
// The distinction the rest of the tree needs is not two-valued. "Still on the
// books" (what a flat gate counts) and "actually protecting a position at the
// exchange" (what a reconciler needs) are different questions, and a single
// IsWorking() bool cannot answer both. Hence a graded classification with one
// chokepoint — ClassifyOrderState — and named predicates over it, so a caller
// states WHICH question it is asking.

// OrderLiveness grades how alive an order is. The zero value is LivenessUnknown
// on purpose: a state we failed to parse must never default into a confident
// answer.
type OrderLiveness int

	// LivenessUnknown — the state is unreadable, unrecognised or absent. NOT

	// taken on it (A24).

	// LivenessPending — created or sent, not yet confirmed by the broker.
	// Counts as standing (a fill can still arrive), but nothing here has been
	// AGREED to, so these terms are not an accepted risk.
	LivenessPending

	// LivenessLive — confirmed and standing AT THE EXCHANGE. `Accepted` is the
	// normal resting state of a stop-market; treating "not Working" as "not
	// live" was error (a) of the four above.
	LivenessLive

	// LivenessLocal — held on this PC, not at the exchange (TriggerPending).
	// Counts as standing, and NEVER as protection.
	LivenessLocal

	// LivenessDying — a cancel is in flight. Still standing (the cancel may
	// fail, and the order can still fill in that window), but on its way out,
	// so its prices are never recorded as accepted.
	LivenessDying

	// LivenessTerminal — history. The only class on which an order may be
	// treated as gone.
