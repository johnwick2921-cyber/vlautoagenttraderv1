// F12 — the order_snapshot frame: the BROKER's working-order book.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The AddOn emitted position, fill, order_update, bar and
// account frames — everything except the one thing a cutover needs to know:
// what orders are resting at the broker RIGHT NOW. Class 33 made cutover leg 4
// read our own armed_orders ledger, and the gate's own note admitted it: "the
// armed_orders ledger (no NT8 order frame — F12 open)". A gate leg answered by
// our own bookkeeping cannot catch the case where the ledger and the broker
// disagree, which is exactly the case a flat gate exists to catch.
//
// order_update frames are per-EVENT: a Go restart loses the picture until the
// next event happens, which may be never on a quiet book. A periodic snapshot
// makes the broker's book re-derivable at any moment, and an EMPTY book arrives
// as `orders: []` — an explicit empty, never an absent frame. That distinction
// is the whole reason leg 4 can be trusted: "no orders" and "no answer" are
// different claims and must never render as the same one.
