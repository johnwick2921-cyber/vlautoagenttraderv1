// W117 slice A — F2 rebuilt: TCP RECEIVE-ORDER EXECUTION.
//
// The earlier #117 / PR-#218 design ran the owning durable consumers ON the
// TCP read goroutine (before the advisory fanout). That failed review: a slow
// durable consumer (SQLite) stalls frame reception, and a callback under the
// execution lock can wedge registration. This design instead gives each
// (symbol, account) owner its OWN worker goroutine:
//
//   - The read loop only ENQUEUES. The queue is a BOUNDED mutex-guarded slice
//     (orderedQueueCap) + a coalesced wake channel (cap 1, so a burst of frames
//     still wakes the worker once). A frame is NEVER dropped: a full queue
//     blocks the enqueue (P2-14) with a per-pass timeout that logs ERROR and
//     bumps a counter, then keeps waiting for room — a stuck durable consumer
//     stalls the read loop LOUDLY instead of growing memory unbounded; the
//     server-side heartbeat-receive stall bounds that state at 60s and forces a
//     reconnect (the AddOn re-syncs its book on reconnect). No SQLite work ever
//     runs on the read goroutine.
//   - The worker drains FIFO and calls each handler OUTSIDE any registry lock
//     (the owner struct is immutable once registered; re-registration replaces
//     the map entry, the old worker drains and exits).
//   - Enqueue stamps each order_update with the snapshot watermark (snapSeq);
//     the worker waits for a post-update order_snapshot before applying, so
//     recordAcceptedRisk never reads the PRE-change broker book (the AddOn
//     sends order_update THEN order_snapshot — VLTraderTCPClient.cs ~1948
//     then ~1955). Bounded wait: on timeout the frame is applied with
//     BookGate=bookNotFresh (the book is suppressed, never read stale).
//   - Frames owned by a registered owner carry OrderedOwned=true on the
//     advisory channel copies, so the legacy consumers skip them (no
//     double-application). No owner registered → flags false → today's
//     behavior byte-identical.
