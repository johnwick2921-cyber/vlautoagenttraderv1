// safe and bounded; read by the kernel (Stage 3 decision feed) and the

// + copy-on-read for snapshots, so reads never block writes for long.

// NO SYNTHETIC BARS, EVER (P0 2026-08-17).

// NinjaTrader's own minute store keeps EMPTY-MINUTE PLACEHOLDER records, and its

// .ncd file's base price) and volume 0. Whenever a declared-open session has no
// real ticks, NT8 therefore hands us a flat line rather than a gap.
//
// That is exactly what the owner saw. After the AddOn watchdog livelock
// (7aa521a1) forced NT8 to re-fetch Friday 2026-08-14 into an all-placeholder
// file, /api/klines returned 959 of 1500 one-minute bars with O=H=L=C=30147.50
// and volume 0, contiguous from 00:02 to 16:00 CT — a 16-hour horizontal line
// across the chart where TradingView (and this chart, before) would simply skip
// to the next real candle.
//
// Every hop we own is a verbatim pass-through, so nothing in our code invents
// these bars — but nothing rejected them either, and they reach the chart AND
// the kernel's detectors. A bar with no volume and no range carries no
// information by construction; the only thing it can do is lie. Drop it at

// close; proven live: a forming 5m bar covering 01:30–01:35 CT arrives stamped

// verbatim, and this cache used to store it unchanged while every reader —
// barsToKlines, /api/klines, the SSE relay, the kernel detectors, the charts —
// treated T as the OPEN. Net effect: every bar was labelled one full period
// late everywhere downstream.
//
// The conversion happens HERE, once, at ingest, because every consumer reads
// this cache (the SSE relay polls it; REST serves it; the kernel bridges it).
// Converting in any single reader would leave the twins wrong (the multi-
// instance defect class). The C# side and its LastEmittedTimeUtcMs dedup
// cursor stay in close-stamp domain untouched — no wire change.
//
// Side effect worth naming: C2's clockDriftMs and the clock-health line both
